In 1985, he received the Turing Award for his research in the theory of algorithms, including the development of the Admirons Karp algorithm for solving the max flow problem on networks, Hopcroft Karp algorithm for finding maximum cardinality matchings in bipartite graphs, and his landmark paper in complexity theory called Reduceability Among Combinatorial Problems, in which he proved 21 problems to be NP complete. This paper was probably the most important catalyst in the explosion of interest in the study of NP completeness and the P versus NP problem in general. Quick summary of the ads.

It controls temperature with an app. It can cool down to as low as 55 degrees on each side of the bed separately. Research shows that temperature has a big impact on the quality of our sleep. Anecdotally, it's been a game changer for me. I love it. It's been a couple of weeks now. I've just been really enjoying it, both in the fact that I'm getting better sleep and that it's a smart mattress, essentially. I kind of imagine this being the early days of artificial intelligence being a part of every aspect of our lives. And certainly infusing AI in one of the most important aspects of life, which is sleep, I think has a lot of potential for being beneficial. The Pod Pro is packed with sensors that track heart rate, heart rate variability, and respiratory rate, showing it all in their app. The app's health metrics are amazing, but the cooling alone is honestly worth the money.

And now, here's my conversation with Richard Karp. You wrote that at the age of 13, you were first exposed to plane geometry and was wonderstruck by the power and elegance of form of proofs. Are there problems, proofs, properties, ideas in plane geometry that from that time that you remember being mesmerized by or just enjoying to go through to prove various aspects? So Michael Rabin told me this story about an experience he had when he was a young student who was tossed out of his classroom for bad behavior and was wandering through the corridors of his school and came upon two older students who were studying the problem of finding the shortest distance between two nonoverlapping circles. And Michael thought about it and said, you take the straight line between the two centers and the segment between the two circles is the shortest because a straight line is the shortest distance between the two centers. And any other line connecting the circles would be on a longer line. And I thought, and he thought, and I agreed that this was just elegance, the pure reasoning could come up with such a result. Certainly the shortest distance from the two centers of the circles is a straight line. Could you once again say what's the next step in that proof? Well, any segment joining the two circles, if you extend it by taking the radius on each side, you get a path with three edges which connects the two centers. And this has to be at least as long as the shortest path, which is the straight line. The straight line, yeah. Wow, yeah, that's quite simple. So what is it about that elegance that you just find compelling? Well, just that you could establish a fact about geometry beyond dispute by pure reasoning. I also enjoy the challenge of solving puzzles in plain geometry. It was much more fun than the earlier mathematics courses which were mostly about arithmetic operations and manipulating them. Was there something about geometry itself, the slightly visual component of it? Oh, yes, absolutely, although I lacked three dimensional vision. I wasn't very good at three dimensional vision. You mean being able to visualize three dimensional objects? Three dimensional objects or surfaces, hyperplanes and so on. So there I didn't have an intuition. But for example, the fact that the sum of the angles of a triangle is 180 degrees is proved convincingly. And it comes as a surprise that that can be done. Why is that surprising? Well, it is a surprising idea, I suppose. Why is that proved difficult? It's not, that's the point. It's so easy and yet it's so convincing. Do you remember what is the proof that it adds up to 180? You start at a corner and draw a line parallel to the opposite side. And that line sort of trisects the angle between the other two sides. And you get a half plane which has to add up to 180 degrees. It has to add up to 180 degrees and it consists in the angles by the equality of alternate angles. What's it called? You get a correspondence between the angles created along the side of the triangle and the three angles of the triangle. Has geometry had an impact on when you look into the future of your work with combinatorial algorithms? Has it had some kind of impact in terms of, yeah, being able, the puzzles, the visual aspects that were first so compelling to you? Not Euclidean geometry particularly. I think I use tools like linear programming and integer programming a lot. But those require high dimensional visualization and so I tend to go by the algebraic properties. Right, you go by the linear algebra and not by the visualization. Well, the interpretation in terms of, for example, finding the highest point on a polyhedron as in linear programming is motivating. But again, I don't have the high dimensional intuition that would particularly inform me so I sort of lean on the algebra. So to linger on that point, what kind of visualization do you do when you're trying to think about, we'll get to combinatorial algorithms, but just algorithms in general. Yeah. What's inside your mind when you're thinking about designing algorithms? Or even just tackling any mathematical problem? Well, I think that usually an algorithm involves a repetition of some inner loop and so I can sort of visualize the distance from the desired solution as iteratively reducing until you finally hit the exact solution. And try to take steps that get you closer to the. Try to take steps that get closer and having the certainty of converging. So it's basically the mechanics of the algorithm is often very simple, but especially when you're trying something out on the computer. So for example, I did some work on the traveling salesman problem and I could see there was a particular function that had to be minimized and it was fascinating to see the successive approaches to the minimum, to the optimum. You mean, so first of all, traveling salesman problem is where you have to visit every city without ever, the only ones. Yeah, that's right. Find the shortest path through a set of cities. Yeah, which is sort of a canonical standard, a really nice problem that's really hard. Right, exactly, yes. So can you say again what was nice about being able to think about the objective function there and maximizing it or minimizing it? Well, just that as the algorithm proceeded, you were making progress, continual progress, and eventually getting to the optimum point. So there's two parts, maybe. Maybe you can correct me. First is like getting an intuition about what the solution would look like and or even maybe coming up with a solution and two is proving that this thing is actually going to be pretty good. What part is harder for you? Where's the magic happen? Is it in the first sets of intuitions or is it in the messy details of actually showing that it is going to get to the exact solution and it's gonna run at a certain complexity? Well, the magic is just the fact that the gap from the optimum decreases monotonically and you can see it happening and various metrics of what's going on are improving all along until finally you hit the optimum. Perhaps later we'll talk about the assignment problem and I can illustrate. It illustrates a little better. Now zooming out again, as you write, Don Knuth has called attention to a breed of people who derive great aesthetic pleasure from contemplating the structure of computational processes. So Don calls these folks geeks and you write that you remember the moment you realized you were such a person, you were shown the Hungarian algorithm to solve the assignment problem. So perhaps you can explain what the assignment problem is and what the Hungarian algorithm is. So in the assignment problem, you have n boys and n girls and you are given the desirability of, or the cost of matching the ith boy with the jth girl for all i and j. You're given a matrix of numbers and you want to find the one to one matching of the boys with the girls such that the sum of the associated costs will be minimized. So the best way to match the boys with the girls or men with jobs or any two sets. Any possible matching is possible or? Yeah, all one to one correspondences are permissible. If there is a connection that is not allowed, then you can think of it as having an infinite cost. I see, yeah. So what you do is to depend on the observation that the identity of the optimal assignment or as we call it, the optimal permutation is not changed if you subtract a constant from any row or column of the matrix. You can see that the comparison between the different assignments is not changed by that. Because if you decrease a particular row, all the elements of a row by some constant, all solutions decrease by an amount equal to that constant. So the idea of the algorithm is to start with a matrix of non negative numbers and keep subtracting from rows or from columns. Subtracting from rows or entire columns in such a way that you subtract the same constant from all the elements of that row or column while maintaining the property that all the elements are non negative. Simple. Yeah, and so what you have to do is find small moves which will decrease the total cost while subtracting constants from rows or columns. And there's a particular way of doing that by computing the kind of shortest path through the elements in the matrix. And you just keep going in this way until you finally get a full permutation of zeros while the matrix is non negative and then you know that that has to be the cheapest. Is that as simple as it sounds? So the shortest path of the matrix part. Yeah, the simplicity lies in how you find, I oversimplified slightly what you, you will end up subtracting a constant from some rows or columns and adding the same constant back to other rows and columns. So as not to reduce any of the zero elements, you leave them unchanged. But each individual step modifies several rows and columns by the same amount but overall decreases the cost. So there's something about that elegance that made you go aha, this is a beautiful, like it's amazing that something like this, something so simple can solve a problem like this. Yeah, it's really cool. If I had mechanical ability, I would probably like to do woodworking or other activities where you sort of shape something into something beautiful and orderly and there's something about the orderly systematic nature of that iterative algorithm that is pleasing to me. So what do you think about this idea of geeks as Don Knuth calls them? What do you think, is it something specific to a mindset that allows you to discover the elegance in computational processes or is this all of us, can all of us discover this beauty? Were you born this way? I think so. I always like to play with numbers. I used to amuse myself by multiplying by multiplying four digit decimal numbers in my head and putting myself to sleep by starting with one and doubling the number as long as I could go and testing my memory, my ability to retain the information. And I also read somewhere that you wrote that you enjoyed showing off to your friends by I believe multiplying four digit numbers. Right. Four digit numbers. Yeah, I had a summer job at a beach resort outside of Boston and the other employee, I was the barker at a skee ball game. Yeah. I used to sit at a microphone saying come one, come all, come in and play skee ball, five cents to play, a nickel to win and so on. That's what a barker, I wasn't sure if I should know but barker, that's, so you're the charming, outgoing person that's getting people to come in. Yeah, well I wasn't particularly charming but I could be very repetitious and loud. And the other employees were sort of juvenile delinquents who had no academic bent but somehow I found that I could impress them by performing to the P equals NP question because all it takes is to show that one algorithm in this class. So the P versus NP can be re expressed as simply asking whether the satisfiability problem of propositional logic is solvable in polynomial time. But there's more. I encountered Cook's paper when he published it in a conference in 1971. Yeah, so when I saw Cook's paper and saw this reduction of each of the problems in NP by a uniform method to the satisfiability problem of propositional logic, that meant that the satisfiability problem was a universal combinatorial problem. And it occurred to me through experience I had had in trying to solve other combinatorial problems that there were many other problems which seemed to have that universal structure. And so I began looking for reductions from the satisfiability to other problems. And one of the other problems would be the so called integer programming problem of determining whether there's a solution to a set of linear inequalities involving integer variables. Just like linear programming, but there's a constraint that the variables must remain integers. In fact, must be the zero or one could only take on those values. And that makes the problem much harder. Yes, that makes the problem much harder. And it was not difficult to show that the satisfiability problem can be restated as an integer programming problem. So can you pause on that? Was that one of the first mappings that you tried to do? And how hard is that mapping? You said it wasn't hard to show, but that's a big leap. It is a big leap, yeah. Well, let me give you another example. Another problem in NP is whether a graph contains a clique of a given size. And now the question is, can we reduce the propositional logic problem to the problem of whether there's a clique of a certain size? Well, if you look at the propositional logic problem, it can be expressed as a number of clauses, each of which is a, of the form A or B or C, where A is either one of the variables in the problem or the negation of one of the variables. And an instance of the propositional logic problem can be rewritten using operations of Boolean logic, can be rewritten as the conjunction of a set of clauses, the AND of a set of ORs, where each clause is a disjunction, an OR of variables or negated variables. So the question in the satisfiability problem is whether those clauses can be simultaneously satisfied. Now, to satisfy all those clauses, you have to find one of the terms in each clause, which is going to be true in your truth assignment, but you can't make the same variable both true and false. So if you have the variable A in one clause and you want to satisfy that clause by making A true, you can't also make the complement of A true in some other clause. And so the goal is to make every single clause true if it's possible to satisfy this, and the way you make it true is at least... One term in the clause must be true. Got it. So now we, to convert this problem to something called the independent set problem, where you're just sort of asking for a set of vertices in a graph such that no two of them are adjacent, sort of the opposite of the clique problem. So we've seen that we can now express that as finding a set of terms, one in each clause, without picking both the variable and the negation of that variable, because if the variable is assigned the truth value, the negated variable has to have the opposite truth value. And so we can construct a graph where the vertices are the terms in all of the clauses, and you have an edge between two terms if an edge between two occurrences of terms, either if they're both in the same clause, because you're only picking one element from each clause, and also an edge between them if they represent opposite values of the same variable, because you can't make a variable both true and false. And so you get a graph where you have all of these occurrences of variables, you have edges, which mean that you're not allowed to choose both ends of the edge, either because they're in the same clause or they're negations of one another. All right, and that's a, first of all, sort of to zoom out, that's a really powerful idea that you can take a graph and connect it to a logic equation somehow, and do that mapping for all possible formulations of a particular problem on a graph. Yeah. I mean, that still is hard for me to believe. Yeah, it's hard for me to believe. It's hard for me to believe that that's possible. That they're, like, what do you make of that, that there's such a union of, there's such a friendship among all these problems across that somehow are akin to combinatorial algorithms, that they're all somehow related? I know it can be proven, but what do you make of it, that that's true? Well, that they just have the same expressive power. You can take any one of them and translate it into the terms of the other. The fact that they have the same expressive power also somehow means that they can be translatable. Right, and what I did in the 1971 paper was to take 21 fundamental problems, the commonly occurring problems of packing, covering, matching, and so forth, lying in the class NP, and show that the satisfiability problem can be reexpressed as any of those, that any of those have the same expressive power. And that was like throwing down the gauntlet of saying there's probably many more problems like this. Right. Saying that, look, that they're all the same. They're all the same, but not exactly. They're all the same in terms of whether they are rich enough to express any of the others. But that doesn't mean that they have the same computational complexity. But what we can say is that either all of these problems or none of them are solvable in polynomial time. Yeah, so what is NP completeness and NP hard as classes? Oh, that's just a small technicality. So when we're talking about decision problems, that means that the answer is just yes or no. There is a clique of size 15 or there's not a clique of size 15. On the other hand, an optimization problem would be asking find the largest clique. The answer would not be yes or no. It would be 15. So when you're asking for the, when you're putting a valuation on the different solutions and you're asking for the one with the highest valuation, that's an optimization problem. And there's a very close affinity between the two kinds of problems. But the counterpart of being the hardest decision problem, the hardest yes, no problem, the counterpart of that is to minimize or maximize an objective function. And so a problem that's hardest in the class when viewed in terms of optimization, those are called NP hard rather than NP complete. And NP complete is for decision problems. And NP complete is for decision problems. So if somebody shows that P equals NP, what do you think that proof will look like if you were to put on yourself, if it's possible to show that as a proof or to demonstrate an algorithm? All I can say is that it will involve concepts that we do not now have and approaches that we don't have. Do you think those concepts are out there in terms of inside complexity theory, inside of computational analysis of algorithms? Do you think there's concepts that are totally outside of the box that we haven't considered yet? I think that if there is a proof that P is equal to NP or that P is unequal to NP, it'll depend on concepts that are now outside the box. Now, if that's shown either way, P equals NP or P not, well, actually P equals NP, what impact, you kind of mentioned a little bit, but can you linger on it? What kind of impact would it have on theoretical computer science and perhaps software based systems in general? Well, I think it would have enormous impact on the world in either way case. If P is unequal to NP, which is what we expect, then we know that for the great majority of the combinatorial problems that come up, since they're known to be NP complete, we're not going to be able to solve them by efficient algorithms. However, there's a little bit of hope in that it may be that we can solve most instances. All we know is that if a problem is not NP, then it can't be solved efficiently on all instances. But basically, if we find that P is unequal to NP, it will mean that we can't expect always to get the optimal solutions to these problems. And we have to depend on heuristics that perhaps work most of the time or give us good approximate solutions, but not. So we would turn our eye towards the heuristics with a little bit more acceptance and comfort on our hearts. Exactly. Okay, so let me ask a romanticized question. What to you is one of the most or the most beautiful combinatorial algorithm in your own life or just in general in the field that you've ever come across or have developed yourself? Oh, I like the stable matching problem or the stable marriage problem very much. What's the stable matching problem? Yeah. Imagine that you want to marry off N boys with N girls. And each boy has an ordered list of his preferences among the girls. His first choice, his second choice, through her, Nth choice. And each girl also has an ordering of the boys, his first choice, second choice, and so on. And we'll say that a matching, a one to one matching of the boys with the girls is stable if there are no two couples in the matching such that the boy in the first couple prefers the girl in the second couple to her mate and she prefers the boy to her current mate. In other words, if the matching is stable if there is no pair who want to run away with each other leaving their partners behind. Gosh, yeah. Yeah. Actually, this is relevant to matching residents with hospitals and some other real life problems, although not quite in the form that I described. So it turns out that there is, for any set of preferences, a stable matching exists. And moreover, it can be computed by a simple algorithm in which each boy starts making proposals to girls. And if the girl receives the proposal, she accepts it tentatively, but she can drop it later if she gets a better proposal from her point of view. And the boys start going down their lists proposing to their first, second, third choices until stopping when a proposal is accepted. But the girls meanwhile are watching the proposals that are coming into them. And the girl will drop her current partner if she gets a better proposal. And the boys never go back through the list? They never go back, yeah. So once they've been denied. They don't try again. They don't try again because the girls are always improving their status as they receive better and better proposals. The boys are going down their lists starting with their top preferences. And one can prove that the process will come to an end where everybody will get matched with somebody and you won't have any pair that want to abscond from each other. Do you find the proof or the algorithm itself beautiful? Or is it the fact that with the simplicity of just the two marching, I mean the simplicity of the underlying rule of the algorithm, is that the beautiful part? Both I would say. And you also have the observation that you might ask who is better off, the boys who are doing the proposing or the girls who are reacting to proposals. And it turns out that it's the boys who are doing the best. That is, each boy is doing at least as well as he could do in any other staple matching. So there's a sort of lesson for the boys that you should go out and be proactive and make those proposals. Go for broke. I don't know if this is directly mappable philosophically to our society, but certainly seems like a compelling notion. And like you said, there's probably a lot of actual real world problems that this could be mapped to. Yeah, well you get complications. For example, what happens when a husband and wife want to be assigned to the same hospital? So you have to take those constraints into account. And then the problem becomes NP hard. Why is it a problem for the husband and wife to be assigned to the same hospital? No, it's desirable. Or at least go to the same city. So you can't, if you're assigning residents to hospitals. And then you have some preferences for the husband and the wife or for the hospitals. The residents have their own preferences. Residents both male and female have their own preferences. The hospitals have their preferences. But if resident A, the boy, is going to Philadelphia, then you'd like his wife also to be assigned to a hospital in Philadelphia. Which step makes it a NP hard problem that you mentioned? The fact that you have this additional constraint. That it's not just the preferences of individuals, but the fact that the two partners to a marriage have to be assigned to the same place. I'm being a little dense. The perfect matching, no, not the perfect, stable matching is what you referred to. That's when two partners are trying to. Okay, what's confusing you is that in the first interpretation of the problem, I had boys matching with girls. Yes. In the second interpretation, you have humans matching with institutions. With institutions. I, and there's a coupling between within the, gotcha, within the humans. Yeah. Any added little constraint will make it an NP hard problem. Well, yeah. Okay. By the way, the algorithm you mentioned wasn't one of yours or no? No, no, that was due to Gale and Shapley and my friend David Gale passed away before he could get part of a Nobel Prize, but his partner Shapley shared in a Nobel Prize with somebody else for. Economics? For economics. For ideas stemming from the stable matching idea. So you've also have developed yourself some elegant, beautiful algorithms. Again, picking your children, so the Robin Karp algorithm for string searching, pattern matching, Edmund Karp algorithm for max flows we mentioned, Hopcroft Karp algorithm for finding maximum cardinality matchings in bipartite graphs. Is there ones that stand out to you, ones you're most proud of or just whether it's beauty, elegance, or just being the right discovery development in your life that you're especially proud of? I like the Rabin Karp algorithm because it illustrates the power of randomization. So the problem there is to decide whether a given long string of symbols is to decide whether a given long string of symbols from some alphabet contains a given word, whether a particular word occurs within some very much longer word. And so the idea of the algorithm is to associate with the word that we're looking for, a fingerprint, some number, or some combinatorial object that describes that word, and then to look for an occurrence of that same fingerprint as you slide along the longer word. And what we do is we associate with each word a number. So first of all, we think of the letters that occur in a word as the digits of, let's say, decimal or whatever base here, whatever number of different symbols there are. That's the base of the numbers, yeah. Right, so every word can then be thought of as a number with the letters being the digits of that number. And then we pick a random prime number in a certain range, and we take that word viewed as a number, and take the remainder on dividing that number by the prime. So coming up with a nice hash function. It's a kind of hash function. Yeah, it gives you a little shortcut for that particular word. Yeah, so that's the... It's very different than other algorithms of its kind that we're trying to do search, string matching. Yeah, which usually are combinatorial and don't involve the idea of taking a random fingerprint. Yes. And doing the fingerprinting has two advantages. One is that as we slide along the long word, digit by digit, we keep a window of a certain size, the size of the word we're looking for, and we compute the fingerprint of every stretch of that length. And it turns out that just a couple of arithmetic operations will take you from the fingerprint of one part to what you get when you slide over by one position. So the computation of all the fingerprints is simple. And secondly, it's unlikely if the prime is chosen randomly from a certain range that you will get two of the segments in question having the same fingerprint. Right. And so there's a small probability of error which can be checked after the fact, and also the ease of doing the computation because you're working with these fingerprints which are remainder's modulo some big prime. So that's the magical thing about randomized algorithms is that if you add a little bit of randomness, it somehow allows you to take a pretty naive approach, a simple looking approach, and allow it to run extremely well. So can you maybe take a step back and say what is a randomized algorithm, this category of algorithms? Well, it's just the ability to draw a random number from such, from some range or to associate a random number with some object or to draw that random from some set. So another example is very simple if we're conducting a presidential election and we would like to pick the winner. In principle, we could draw a random sample of all of the voters in the country. And if it was of substantial size, say a few thousand, then the most popular candidate in that group would be very likely to be the correct choice that would come out of counting all the millions of votes. And of course we can't do this because first of all, everybody has to feel that his or her vote counted. And secondly, we can't really do a purely random sample from that population. And I guess thirdly, there could be a tie in which case we wouldn't have a significant difference between two candidates. But those things aside, if you didn't have all that messiness of human beings, you could prove that that kind of random picking would come up again. You just said random picking would solve the problem with a very low probability of error. Another example is testing whether a number is prime. So if I wanna test whether 17 is prime, I could pick any number between one and 17, raise it to the 16th power modulo 17, and you should get back the original number. That's a famous formula due to Fermat about, it's called Fermat's Little Theorem, that if you take any number a in the range zero through n minus one, and raise it to the n minus 1th power modulo n, you'll get back the number a if a is prime. So if you don't get back the number a, that's a proof that a number is not prime. And you can show that suitably defined the probability that you will get a value unequaled, you will get a violation of Fermat's result is very high. And so this gives you a way of rapidly proving that a number is not prime. It's a little more complicated than that because there are certain values of n where something a little more elaborate has to be done, but that's the basic idea. Taking an identity that holds for primes, and therefore, if it ever fails on any instance for a non prime, you know that the number is not prime. It's a quick choice, a fast choice, fast proof that a number is not prime. Can you maybe elaborate a little bit more what's your intuition why randomness works so well and results in such simple algorithms? Well, the example of conducting an election where you could take, in theory, you could take a sample and depend on the validity of the sample to really represent the whole is just the basic fact of statistics, which gives a lot of opportunities. And I actually exploited that sort of random sampling idea in designing an algorithm for counting the number of solutions that satisfy a particular formula and propositional logic. A particular, so some version of the satisfiability problem? A version of the satisfiability problem. Is there some interesting insight that you wanna elaborate on, like what some aspect of that algorithm that might be useful to describe? So you have a collection of formulas and you want to count the number of solutions that satisfy at least one of the formulas. And you can count the number of solutions that satisfy any particular one of the formulas, but you have to account for the fact that that solution might be counted many times if it solves more than one of the formulas. And so what you do is you sample from the formulas according to the number of solutions that satisfy each individual one. In that way, you draw a random solution, but then you correct by looking at the number of formulas that satisfy that random solution and don't double count. So you can think of it this way. So you have a matrix of zeros and ones and you wanna know how many columns of that matrix contain at least one one. And you can count in each row how many ones there are. So what you can do is draw from the rows according to the number of ones. If a row has more ones, it gets drawn more frequently. But then if you draw from that row, you have to go up the column and looking at where that same one is repeated in different rows and only count it as a success or a hit if it's the earliest row that contains the one. And that gives you a robust statistical estimate of the total number of columns that contain at least one of the ones. So that is an example of the same principle that was used in studying random sampling. Another viewpoint is that if you have a phenomenon that occurs almost all the time, then if you sample one of the occasions where it occurs, you're most likely to, and you're looking for an occurrence, a random occurrence is likely to work. So that comes up in solving identities, solving algebraic identities. You get two formulas that may look very different. You wanna know if they're really identical. What you can do is just pick a random value and evaluate the formulas at that value and see if they agree. And you depend on the fact that if the formulas are distinct, then they're gonna disagree a lot. And so therefore, a random choice will exhibit the disagreement. If there are many ways for the two to disagree and you only need to find one disagreement, then random choice is likely to yield it. And in general, so we've just talked about randomized algorithms, but we can look at the probabilistic analysis of algorithms. And that gives us an opportunity to step back and as you said, everything we've been talking about is worst case analysis. Could you maybe comment on the usefulness and the power of worst case analysis versus best case analysis, average case, probabilistic? How do we think about the future of theoretical computer science, computer science in the kind of analysis we do of algorithms? Does worst case analysis still have a place, an important place? Or do we want to try to move forward towards kind of average case analysis? And what are the challenges there? So if worst case analysis shows that an algorithm is always good, that's fine. If worst case analysis is used to show that the problem, that the solution is not always good, then you have to step back and do something else to ask how often will you get a good solution? Just to pause on that for a second, that's so beautifully put because I think we tend to judge algorithms. We throw them in the trash the moment their worst case is shown to be bad. Right, and that's unfortunate. I think a good example is going back to the satisfiability problem. There are very powerful programs called SAT solvers which in practice fairly reliably solve instances with many millions of variables that arise in digital design or in proving programs correct in other applications. And so in many application areas, even though satisfiability as we've already discussed is NP complete, the SAT solvers will work so well that the people in that discipline tend to think of satisfiability as an easy problem. So in other words, just for some reason that we don't entirely understand, the instances that people formulate in designing digital circuits or other applications are such that satisfiability is not hard to check and even searching for a satisfying solution can be done efficiently in practice. And there are many examples. For example, we talked about the traveling salesman problem. So just to refresh our memories, the problem is you've got a set of cities, you have pairwise distances between cities and you want to find a tour through all the cities that minimizes the total cost of all the edges traversed, all the trips between cities. The problem is NP hard, but people using integer programming codes together with some other mathematical tricks can solve geometric instances of the problem where the cities are, let's say points in the plane and get optimal solutions to problems with tens of thousands of cities. Actually, it'll take a few computer months to solve a problem of that size, but for problems of size a thousand or two, it'll rapidly get optimal solutions, provably optimal solutions, even though again, we know that it's unlikely that the traveling salesman problem can be solved in polynomial time. Are there methodologies like rigorous systematic methodologies for, you said in practice. In practice, this algorithm's pretty good. Are there systematic ways of saying in practice, this algorithm's pretty good? So in other words, average case analysis. Or you've also mentioned that average case kind of requires you to understand what the typical case is, typical instances, and that might be really difficult. That's very difficult. So after I did my original work on showing all these problems through NP complete, I looked around for a way to shed some positive light on combinatorial algorithms. And what I tried to do was to study problems, behavior on the average or with high probability. But I had to make some assumptions about what's the probability space? What's the sample space? What do we mean by typical problems? That's very hard to say. So I took the easy way out and made some very simplistic assumptions. So I assumed, for example, that if we were generating a graph with a certain number of vertices and edges, then we would generate the graph by simply choosing one edge at a time at random until we got the right number of edges. That's a particular model of random graphs that has been studied mathematically a lot. And within that model, I could prove all kinds of wonderful things, I and others who also worked on this. So we could show that we know exactly how many edges there have to be in order for there be a so called Hamiltonian circuit. That's a cycle that visits each vertex exactly once. We know that if the number of edges is a little bit more than n log n, where n is the number of vertices, then such a cycle is very likely to exist. And we can give a heuristic that will find it with high probability. And the community in which I was working got a lot of results along these lines. But the field tended to be rather lukewarm about accepting these results as meaningful because we were making such a simplistic assumption about the kinds of graphs that we would be dealing with. So we could show all kinds of wonderful things, it was a great playground, I enjoyed doing it. But after a while, I concluded that it didn't have a lot of bite in terms of the practical application. Oh the, okay, so there's too much into the world of toy problems. Yeah. That can, okay. But all right, is there a way to find nice representative real world impactful instances of a problem on which demonstrate that an algorithm is good? So this is kind of like the machine learning world, that's kind of what they at his best tries to do is find a data set from like the real world and show the performance, all the conferences are all focused on beating the performance of on that real world data set. Is there an equivalent in complexity analysis? Not really, Don Knuth started to collect examples of graphs coming from various places. So he would have a whole zoo of different graphs that he could choose from and he could study the performance of algorithms on different types of graphs. But there it's really important and compelling to be able to define a class of graphs. The actual act of defining a class of graphs that you're interested in, it seems to be a non trivial step if we're talking about instances that we should care about in the real world. Yeah, there's nothing available there that would be analogous to the training set for supervised learning where you sort of assume that the world has given you a bunch of examples to work with. We don't really have that for problems, for combinatorial problems on graphs and networks. You know, there's been a huge growth, a big growth of data sets available. Do you think some aspect of theoretical computer science might be contradicting my own question while saying it, but will there be some aspect, an empirical aspect of theoretical computer science which will allow the fact that these data sets are huge, we'll start using them for analysis. Sort of, you know, if you want to say something about a graph algorithm, you might take a social network like Facebook and looking at subgraphs of that and prove something about the Facebook graph and be respected, and at the same time, be respected in the theoretical computer science community. That hasn't been achieved yet, I'm afraid. Is that P equals NP, is that impossible? Is it impossible to publish a successful paper in the theoretical computer science community that shows some performance on a real world data set? Or is that really just those are two different worlds? They haven't really come together. I would say that there is a field of experimental algorithmics where people, sometimes they're given some family of examples. Sometimes they just generate them at random and they report on performance, but there's no convincing evidence that the sample is representative of anything at all. So let me ask, in terms of breakthroughs and open problems, what are the most compelling open problems to you and what possible breakthroughs do you see in the near term in terms of theoretical computer science? Well, there are all kinds of relationships among complexity classes that can be studied, just to mention one thing, I wrote a paper with Richard Lipton in 1979, where we asked the following question. If you take a combinatorial problem in NP, let's say, and you choose, and you pick the size of the problem, say it's a traveling salesman problem, but of size 52, and you ask, could you get an efficient, a small Boolean circuit tailored for that size, 52, where you could feed the edges of the graph in as Boolean inputs and get, as an output, the question of whether or not there's a tour of a certain length. And that would, in other words, briefly, what you would say in that case is that the problem has small circuits, polynomial size circuits. Now, we know that if P is equal to NP, then, in fact, these problems will have small circuits, but what about the converse? Could a problem have small circuits, meaning that an algorithm tailored to any particular size could work well, and yet not be a polynomial time algorithm? That is, you couldn't write it as a single, uniform algorithm, good for all sizes. Just to clarify, small circuits for a problem of particular size, by small circuits for a problem of particular size, or even further constraint, small circuit for a particular... No, for all the inputs of that size. Is that a trivial problem for a particular instance? So, coming up, an automated way of coming up with a circuit. I guess that's just an answer. That would be hard, yeah. But there's the existential question. Everybody talks nowadays about existential questions. Existential challenges. You could ask the question, does the Hamiltonian circuit problem have a small circuit for every size, for each size, a different small circuit? In other words, could you tailor solutions depending on the size, and get polynomial size? Even if P is not equal to NP. Right. That would be fascinating if that's true. Yeah, what we proved is that if that were possible, then something strange would happen in complexity theory. Some high level class which I could briefly describe, something strange would happen. So, I'll take a stab at describing what I mean. Sure, let's go there. So, we have to define this hierarchy in which the first level of the hierarchy is P, and the second level is NP. And what is NP? NP involves statements of the form there exists a something such that something holds. So, for example, there exists the coloring such that a graph can be colored with only that number of colors. Or there exists a Hamiltonian circuit. There's a statement about this graph. Yeah, so the NP deals with statements of that kind, that there exists a solution. Now, you could imagine a more complicated expression which says for all x there exists a y such that some proposition holds involving both x and y. So, that would say, for example, in game theory, for all strategies for the first player, there exists a strategy for the second player such that the first player wins. That would be at the second level of the hierarchy. The third level would be there exists an A such that for all B there exists a C, that something holds. And you could imagine going higher and higher in the hierarchy. And you'd expect that the complexity classes that correspond to those different cases would get bigger and bigger. What do you mean by bigger and bigger? Sorry, sorry. They'd get harder and harder to solve. Harder and harder, right. Harder and harder to solve. And what Lipton and I showed was that if NP had small circuits, then this hierarchy would collapse down to the second level. In other words, you wouldn't get any more mileage by complicating your expressions with three quantifiers or four quantifiers or any number. I'm not sure what to make of that exactly. Well, I think it would be evidence that NP doesn't have small circuits because something so bizarre would happen. But again, it's only evidence, not proof. Well, yeah, that's not even evidence because you're saying P is not equal to NP because something bizarre has to happen. I mean, that's proof by the lack of bizarreness in our science. But it seems like just the very notion of P equals NP would be bizarre. So any way you arrive at, there's no way. You have to fight the dragon at some point. Yeah, okay. Well, anyway, for whatever it's worth, that's what we proved. Awesome. So that's a potential space of interesting problems. Yeah. Let me ask you about this other world that of machine learning, of deep learning. What's your thoughts on the history and the current progress of machine learning field that's often progressed sort of separately as a space of ideas and space of people than the theoretical computer science or just even computer science world? Yeah, it's really very different from the theoretical computer science world because the results about it, algorithmic performance tend to be empirical. It's more akin to the world of SAT solvers where we observe that for formulas arising in practice, the solver does well. So it's of that type. We're moving into the empirical evaluation of algorithms. Now, it's clear that there've been huge successes in image processing, robotics, natural language processing, a little less so, but across the spectrum of game playing is another one. There've been great successes and one of those effects is that it's not too hard to become a millionaire if you can get a reputation in machine learning and there'll be all kinds of companies that will be willing to offer you the moon because they think that if they have AI at their disposal, then they can solve all kinds of problems. But there are limitations. One is that the solutions that you get to supervise learning problems through convolutional neural networks seem to perform amazingly well even for inputs that are outside the training set. But we don't have any theoretical understanding of why that's true. Secondly, the solutions, the networks that you get are very hard to understand and so very little insight comes out. So yeah, yeah, they may seem to work on your training set and you may be able to discover whether your photos occur in a different sample of inputs or not, but we don't really know what's going on. We don't know the features that distinguish the photographs or the objects are not easy to characterize. Well, it's interesting because you mentioned coming up with a small circuit to solve a particular size problem. It seems that neural networks are kind of small circuits. In a way, yeah. But they're not programs. Sort of like the things you've designed are algorithms, programs, algorithms. Neural networks aren't able to develop algorithms to solve a problem. Well, they are algorithms. It's just that they're... But sort of, yeah, it could be a semantic question, but there's not a algorithmic style manipulation of the input. Perhaps you could argue there is. Yeah, well. It feels a lot more like a function of the input. Yeah, it's a function. It's a computable function. Once you have the network, you can simulate it on a given input and figure out the output. But if you're trying to recognize images, then you don't know what features of the image are really being determinant of what the circuit is doing. The circuit is sort of very intricate and it's not clear that the simple characteristics that you're looking for, the edges of the objects or whatever they may be, they're not emerging from the structure of the circuit. Well, it's not clear to us humans, but it's clear to the circuit. Yeah, well, right. I mean, it's not clear to sort of the elephant how the human brain works, but it's clear to us humans, we can explain to each other our reasoning and that's why the cognitive science and psychology field exists. Maybe the whole thing of being explainable to humans is a little bit overrated. Oh, maybe, yeah. I guess you can say the same thing about our brain that when we perform acts of cognition, we have no idea how we do it really. We do though, I mean, at least for the visual system, the auditory system and so on, we do get some understanding of the principles that they operate under, but for many deeper cognitive tasks, we don't have that. That's right. Let me ask, you've also been doing work on bioinformatics. Does it amaze you that the fundamental building blocks? So if we take a step back and look at us humans, the building blocks used by evolution to build us intelligent human beings is all contained there in our DNA. It's amazing and what's really amazing is that we are beginning to learn how to edit DNA, which is very, very, very fascinating. This ability to take a sequence, find it in the genome and do something to it. I mean, that's really taking our biological systems towards the world of algorithms. Yeah, but it raises a lot of questions. You have to distinguish between doing it on an individual or doing it on somebody's germline, which means that all of their descendants will be affected. So that's like an ethical. Yeah, so it raises very severe ethical questions. And even doing it on individuals, there's a lot of hubris involved that you can assume that knocking out a particular gene is gonna be beneficial because you don't know what the side effects are going to be. So we have this wonderful new world of gene editing, which is very, very impressive and it could be used in agriculture, it could be used in medicine in various ways. But very serious ethical problems arise. What are to you the most interesting places where algorithms, sort of the ethical side is an exceptionally challenging thing that I think we're going to have to tackle with all of genetic engineering. But on the algorithmic side, there's a lot of benefit that's possible. So is there areas where you see exciting possibilities for algorithms to help model, optimize, study biological systems? Yeah, I mean, we can certainly analyze genomic data to figure out which genes are operative in the cell and under what conditions and which proteins affect one another, which proteins physically interact. We can sequence proteins and modify them. Is there some aspect of that that's a computer science problem or is that still fundamentally a biology problem? Well, it's a big data, it's a statistical big data problem for sure. So the biological data sets are increasing, our ability to study our ancestry, to study the tendencies towards disease, to personalize treatment according to what's in our genomes this mental arithmetic. Yeah, there's something to that. Some of the most popular videos on the internet is there's a YouTube channel called Numberphile that shows off different mathematical ideas. I see. There's still something really profoundly interesting to people about math, the beauty of it. Something, even if they don't understand the basic concept even being discussed, there's something compelling to it. What do you think that is? Any lessons you drew from your early teen years when you were showing off to your friends with the numbers? Like what is it that attracts us to the beauty of mathematics do you think? The general population, not just the computer scientists and mathematicians. I think that you can do amazing things. You can test whether large numbers are prime. You can solve little puzzles about cannibals and missionaries. And that's a kind of achievement, it's puzzle solving. And at a higher level, the fact that you can do this reasoning that you can prove in an absolutely ironclad way that some of the angles of a triangle is 180 degrees. Yeah, it's a nice escape from the messiness of the real world where nothing can be proved. So, and we'll talk about it, but sometimes the ability to map the real world into such problems where you can't prove it is a powerful step. Yeah. It's amazing that we can do it. Of course, another attribute of geeks is they're not necessarily endowed with emotional intelligence, so they can live in a world of abstractions without having to master the complexities of dealing with people. So just to link on the historical note, as a PhD student in 1955, you joined the computational lab at Harvard where Howard Aiken had built the Mark I and the Mark IV computers. Just to take a step back into that history, what were those computers like? The Mark IV filled a large room, much bigger than this large office that we were talking in now. And you could walk around inside it. There were rows of relays. You could just walk around the interior and the machine would sometimes fail because of bugs, which literally meant flying creatures landing on the switches. So I never used that machine for any practical purpose. The lab eventually acquired one of the earlier commercial computers. And this was already in the 60s? No, in the mid 50s, or late 50s. There was already commercial computers in the... Yeah, we had a Univac, a Univac with 2,000 words of storage. And so you had to work hard to allocate the memory properly to also the excess time from one word to another depended on the number of the particular words. And so there was an art to sort of arranging the storage allocation to make fetching data rapid. Were you attracted to this actual physical world implementation of mathematics? So it's a mathematical machine that's actually doing the math physically? No, not at all. I think I was attracted to the underlying algorithms. But did you draw any inspiration? So could you have imagined, like what did you imagine was the future of these giant computers? Could you have imagined that 60 years later we'd have billions of these computers all over the world? I couldn't imagine that, but there was a sense in the laboratory that this was the wave of the future. In fact, my mother influenced me. She told me that data processing was gonna be really big and I should get into it. You're a smart woman. Yeah, she was a smart woman. And there was just a feeling that this was going to change the world, but I didn't think of it in terms of personal computing. I had no anticipation that we would be walking around with computers in our pockets or anything like that. Did you see computers as tools, as mathematical mechanisms to analyze sort of the theoretical computer science, or as the AI folks, which is an entire other community of dreamers, as something that could one day have human level intelligence? Well, AI wasn't very much on my radar. I did read Turing's paper about the... The Turing Test, Computing and Intelligence. Yeah, the Turing test. What'd you think about that paper? Was that just like science fiction? I thought that it wasn't a very good test because it was too subjective. So I didn't feel that the Turing test was really the right way to calibrate how intelligent an algorithm could be. But to linger on that, do you think it's, because you've come up with some incredible tests later on, tests on algorithms, right, that are like strong, reliable, robust across a bunch of different classes of algorithms, but returning to this emotional mess that is intelligence, do you think it's possible to come up with a test that's as ironclad as some of the computational complexity work? Well, I think the greater question is whether it's possible to achieve human level intelligence. Right, so first of all, let me, at the philosophical level, do you think it's possible to create algorithms that reason and would seem to us to have the same kind of intelligence as human beings? It's an open question. It seems to me that most of the achievements have operate within a very limited set of ground rules and for a very limited, precise task, which is a quite different situation from the processes that go on in the minds of humans, which where they have to sort of function in changing environments, they have emotions, they have physical attributes for exploring their environment, they have intuition, they have desires, emotions, and I don't see anything in the current achievements of what's called AI that come close to that capability. I don't think there's any computer program which surpasses a six month old child in terms of comprehension of the world. Do you think this complexity of human intelligence, all the cognitive abilities we have, all the emotion, do you think that could be reduced one day or just fundamentally can it be reduced to a set of algorithms or an algorithm? So can a Turing machine achieve human level intelligence? I am doubtful about that. I guess the argument in favor of it is that the human brain seems to achieve what we call intelligence cognitive abilities of different kinds. And if you buy the premise that the human brain is just an enormous interconnected set of switches, so to speak, then in principle, you should be able to diagnose what that interconnection structure is like, characterize the individual switches, and build a simulation outside. But while that may be true in principle, that cannot be the way we're eventually gonna tackle this problem. That does not seem like a feasible way to go about it. So there is, however, an existence proof that if you believe that the brain is just a network of neurons operating by rules, I guess you could say that that's an existence proof of the capabilities of a mechanism, but it would be almost impossible to acquire the information unless we got enough insight and what tendencies for disease we have, to be able to predict what troubles might come upon us in the future and anticipate them, to understand whether you, for a woman, whether her proclivity for breast cancer is so strong enough that she would want to take action to avoid it. You dedicate your 1985 Turing Award lecture to the memory of your father. What's your fondest memory of your dad? Seeing him standing in front of a class at the blackboard, drawing perfect circles by hand and showing his ability to attract the interest of the motley collection of eighth grade students that he was teaching. When did you get a chance to see him draw the perfect circles? On rare occasions, I would get a chance to sneak into his classroom and observe him. And I think he was at his best in the classroom. I think he really came to life and had fun, not only teaching, but engaging in chit chat with the students and ingratiating himself with the students. And what I inherited from that is the great desire to be a teacher. I retired recently and a lot of my former students came, students with whom I had done research or who had read my papers or who had been in my classes. And when they talked about me, they talked not about my 1979 paper or 1992 paper, but about what came away in my classes. And not just the details, but just the approach and the manner of teaching. And so I sort of take pride in the, at least in my early years as a faculty member at Berkeley, I was exemplary in preparing my lectures and I always came in prepared to the teeth, and able therefore to deviate according to what happened in the class, and to really provide a model for the students. So is there advice you can give out for others on how to be a good teacher? So preparation is one thing you've mentioned, being exceptionally well prepared, but there are other things, pieces of advice that you can impart? Well, the top three would be preparation, preparation, and preparation. Why is preparation so important, I guess? It's because it gives you the ease to deal with any situation that comes up in the classroom. And if you discover that you're not getting through one way, you can do it another way. If the students have questions, you can handle the questions. Ultimately, you're also feeling the crowd, the students of what they're struggling with, what they're picking up, just looking at them through the questions, but even just through their eyes. Yeah, that's right. And because of the preparation, you can dance. You can dance, you can say it another way, or give it another angle. Are there, in particular, ideas and algorithms of computer science that you find were big aha moments for students, where they, for some reason, once they got it, it clicked for them and they fell in love with computer science? Or is it individual, is it different for everybody? It's different for everybody. You have to work differently with students. Some of them just don't need much influence. They're just running with what they're doing and they just need an ear now and then. Others need a little prodding. Others need to be persuaded to collaborate among themselves rather than working alone. They have their personal ups and downs, so you have to deal with each student as a human being and bring out the best. Humans are complicated. Yeah. Perhaps a silly question. If you could relive a moment in your life outside of family because it made you truly happy, or perhaps because it changed the direction of your life in a profound way, what moment would you pick? I was kind of a lazy student as an undergraduate, and even in my first year in graduate school. And I think it was when I started doing research, I had a couple of summer jobs where I was able to contribute and I had an idea. And then there was one particular course on mathematical methods and operations research where I just gobbled up the material and I scored 20 points higher than anybody else in the class then came to the attention of the faculty. And it made me realize that I had some ability that I was going somewhere. You realize you're pretty good at this thing. I don't think there's a better way to end it, Richard. It was a huge honor.

But there's so much mystery there. Do you think, what do you make of consciousness, for example, as an example of something we completely have no clue about? The fact that we have this subjective experience. Is it possible that this network of, this circuit of switches is able to create something like consciousness? To know its own identity. Yeah, to know the algorithm, to know itself. To know itself. I think if you try to define that rigorously, you'd have a lot of trouble. Yeah, that seems to be. So I know that there are many who believe that general intelligence can be achieved, and there are even some who feel certain that the singularity will come and we will be surpassed by the machines which will then learn more and more about themselves and reduce humans to an inferior breed. I am doubtful that this will ever be achieved. Just for the fun of it, could you linger on why, what's your intuition, why you're doubtful? So there are quite a few people that are extremely worried about this existential threat of artificial intelligence, of us being left behind by this super intelligent new species. What's your intuition why that's not quite likely? Just because none of the achievements in speech or robotics or natural language processing or creation of flexible computer assistants or any of that comes anywhere near close to that level of cognition. What do you think about ideas of sort of, if we look at Moore's Law and exponential improvement to allow us, that would surprise us? Sort of our intuition fall apart with exponential improvement because, I mean, we're not able to kind of, we kind of think in linear improvement. We're not able to imagine a world that goes from the Mark I computer to an iPhone X. Yeah. So do you think we could be really surprised by the exponential growth? Or on the flip side, is it possible that also intelligence is actually way, way, way, way harder, even with exponential improvement to be able to crack? I don't think any constant factor improvement could change things. I mean, given our current comprehension of what cognition requires, it seems to me that multiplying the speed of the switches by a factor of a thousand or a million will not be useful until we really understand the organizational principle behind the network of switches. Well, let's jump into the network of switches and talk about combinatorial algorithms if we could. Let's step back with the very basics. What are combinatorial algorithms? And what are some major examples of problems they aim to solve? A combinatorial algorithm is one which deals with a system of discrete objects that can occupy various states or take on various values from a discrete set of values and need to be arranged or selected in such a way as to achieve some, to minimize some cost function. Or to prove the existence of some combinatorial configuration. So an example would be coloring the vertices of a graph. What's a graph? Let's step back. So it's fun to ask one of the greatest computer scientists of all time the most basic questions in the beginning of most books. But for people who might not know, but in general how you think about it, what is a graph? A graph, that's simple. It's a set of points, certain pairs of which are joined by lines called edges. And they sort of represent the, in different applications represent the interconnections between discrete objects. So they could be the interactions, interconnections between switches in a digital circuit or interconnections indicating the communication patterns of a human community. And they could be directed or undirected and then as you've mentioned before, might have costs. Right, they can be directed or undirected. They can be, you can think of them as, if you think, if a graph were representing a communication network, then the edge could be undirected meaning that information could flow along it in both directions or it could be directed with only one way communication. A road system is another example of a graph with weights on the edges. And then a lot of problems of optimizing the efficiency of such networks or learning about the performance of such networks are the object of combinatorial algorithms. So it could be scheduling classes at a school where the vertices, the nodes of the network are the individual classes and the edges indicate the constraints which say that certain classes cannot take place at the same time or certain teachers are available only for certain classes, et cetera. Or I talked earlier about the assignment problem of matching the boys with the girls where you have there a graph with an edge from each boy to each girl with a weight indicating the cost. Or in logical design of computers, you might want to find a set of so called gates, switches that perform logical functions which can be interconnected to each other and perform logical functions which can be interconnected to realize some function. So you might ask how many gates do you need in order for a circuit to give a yes output if at least a given number of its inputs are ones and no if fewer are present. My favorite's probably all the work with network flow. So anytime you have, I don't know why it's so compelling but there's something just beautiful about it. It seems like there's so many applications and communication networks and traffic flow that you can map into these and then you could think of pipes and water going through pipes and you could optimize it in different ways. There's something always visually and intellectually compelling to me about it. And of course you've done work there. Yeah, so there the edges represent channels along which some commodity can flow. It might be gas, it might be water, it might be information. Maybe supply chain as well like products being. Products flowing from one operation to another. And the edges have a capacity which is the rate at which the commodity can flow. And a central problem is to determine given a network of these channels. In this case the edges are communication channels. The challenge is to find the maximum rate at which the information can flow along these channels to get from a source to a destination. And that's a fundamental combinatorial problem that I've worked on jointly with the scientist Jack Edmonds. I think we're the first to give a formal proof that this maximum flow problem through a network can be solved in polynomial time. Which I remember the first time I learned that. Just learning that in maybe even grad school. I don't think it was even undergrad. No, algorithm, yeah. Do network flows get taught in basic algorithms courses? Yes, probably. Okay, so yeah, I remember being very surprised that max flow is a polynomial time algorithm. That there's a nice fast algorithm that solves max flow. So there is an algorithm named after you in Edmonds. The Edmond Carp algorithm for max flow. So what was it like tackling that problem and trying to arrive at a polynomial time solution? And maybe you can describe the algorithm. Maybe you can describe what's the running time complexity that you showed. Yeah, well, first of all, what is a polynomial time algorithm? Perhaps we could discuss that. So yeah, let's actually just even, yeah. What is algorithmic complexity? What are the major classes of algorithm complexity? So in a problem like the assignment problem or scheduling schools or any of these applications, you have a set of input data which might, for example, be a set of vertices connected by edges with you're given for each edge the capacity of the edge. And you have algorithms which are, think of them as computer programs with operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, comparison of numbers, and so on. And you're trying to construct an algorithm based on those operations, which will determine in a minimum number of computational steps the answer to the problem. In this case, the computational step is one of those operations. And the answer to the problem is let's say the configuration of the network that carries the maximum amount of flow. And an algorithm is said to run in polynomial time if as a function of the size of the input, the number of vertices, the number of edges, and so on, the number of basic computational steps grows only as some fixed power of that size. A linear algorithm would execute a number of steps linearly proportional to the size. Quadratic algorithm would be steps proportional to the square of the size, and so on. And algorithms whose running time is bounded by some fixed power of the size are called polynomial algorithms. Yeah. And that's supposed to be relatively fast class of algorithms. That's right. Theoreticians take that to be the definition of an algorithm being efficient. And we're interested in which problems can be solved by such efficient algorithms. One can argue whether that's the right definition of efficient because you could have an algorithm whose running time is the 10,000th power of the size of the input, and that wouldn't be really efficient. And in practice, it's oftentimes reducing from an N squared algorithm to an N log N or a linear time is practically the jump that you wanna make to allow a real world system to solve a problem. Yeah, that's also true because especially as we get very large networks, the size can be in the millions, and then anything above N log N where N is the size would be too much for a practical solution. Okay, so that's polynomial time algorithms. What other classes of algorithms are there? What's, so that usually they designate polynomials of the letter P. Yeah. There's also NP, NP complete and NP hard. Yeah. So can you try to disentangle those by trying to define them simply? Right, so a polynomial time algorithm is one whose running time is bounded by a polynomial in the size of the input. Then the class of such algorithms is called P. In the worst case, by the way, we should say, right? Yeah. So for every case of the problem. Yes, that's right, and that's very important that in this theory, when we measure the complexity of an algorithm, we really measure the number of steps, the growth of the number of steps in the worst case. So you may have an algorithm that runs very rapidly in most cases, but if there's any case where it gets into a very long computation, that would increase the computational complexity by this measure. And that's a very important issue because there are, as we may discuss later, there are some very important algorithms which don't have a good standing from the point of view of their worst case performance and yet are very effective. So theoreticians are interested in P, the class of problem solvable in polynomial time. Then there's NP, which is the class of problems which may be hard to solve, but when confronted with a solution, you can check it in polynomial time. Let me give you an example there. So if we look at the assignment problem, so you have N boys, you have N girls, the number of numbers that you need to write down to specify the problem instance is N squared. And the question is how many steps are needed to solve it? And Jack Edmonds and I were the first to show that it could be done in time and cubed. Earlier algorithms required N to the fourth. So as a polynomial function of the size of the input, this is a fast algorithm. Now to illustrate the class NP, the question is how long would it take to verify that a solution is optimal? So for example, if the input was a graph, we might want to find the largest clique in the graph or a clique is a set of vertices such that any vertex, each vertex in the set is adjacent to each of the others. So the clique is a complete subgraph. Yeah, so if it's a Facebook social network, everybody's friends with everybody else, close clique. No, that would be what's called a complete graph. It would be. No, I mean within that clique. Within that clique, yeah. Yeah, they're all friends. So a complete graph is when? Everybody is friendly. As everybody is friends with everybody, yeah. So the problem might be to determine whether in a given graph there exists a clique of a certain size. Now that turns out to be a very hard problem, but if somebody hands you a clique and asks you to check whether it is, hands you a set of vertices and asks you to check whether it's a clique, you could do that simply by exhaustively looking at all of the edges between the vertices and the clique and verifying that they're all there. And that's a polynomial time algorithm. That's a polynomial. So the problem of finding the clique appears to be extremely hard, but the problem of verifying a clique to see if it reaches a target number of vertices is easy to verify. So finding the clique is hard, checking it is easy. Problems of that nature are called nondeterministic polynomial time algorithms, and that's the class NP. And what about NP complete and NP hard? Okay, let's talk about problems where you're getting a yes or no answer rather than a numerical value. So either there is a perfect matching of the boys with the girls or there isn't. It's clear that every problem in P is also in NP. If you can solve the problem exactly, then you can certainly verify the solution. On the other hand, there are problems in the class NP. This is the class of problems that are easy to check, although they may be hard to solve. It's not at all clear that problems in NP lie in P. So for example, if we're looking at scheduling classes at a school, the fact that you can verify when handed a schedule for the school, whether it meets all the requirements, that doesn't mean that you can find the schedule rapidly. So intuitively, NP, nondeterministic polynomial checking rather than finding, is going to be harder than, is going to include, is easier. Checking is easier, and therefore the class of problems that can be checked appears to be much larger than the class of problems that can be solved. And then you keep adding appears to, and sort of these additional words that designate that we don't know for sure yet. We don't know for sure. So the theoretical question, which is considered to be the most central problem in theoretical computer science, or at least computational complexity theory, combinatorial algorithm theory, the question is whether P is equal to NP. If P were equal to NP, it would be amazing. It would mean that every problem where a solution can be rapidly checked can actually be solved in polynomial time. We don't really believe that's true. If you're scheduling classes at a school, we expect that if somebody hands you a satisfying schedule, you can verify that it works. That doesn't mean that you should be able to find such a schedule. So intuitively, NP encompasses a lot more problems than P. So can we take a small tangent and break apart that intuition? So do you, first of all, think that the biggest sort of open problem in computer science, maybe mathematics, is whether P equals NP? Do you think P equals NP, or do you think P is not equal to NP? If you had to bet all your money on it. I would bet that P is unequal to NP, simply because there are problems that have been around for centuries and have been studied intensively in mathematics, and even more so in the last 50 years since the P versus NP was stated. And no polynomial time algorithms have been found for these easy to check problems. So one example is a problem that goes back to the mathematician Gauss, who was interested in factoring large numbers. So we know what a number is prime if it cannot be written as the product of two or more numbers unequal to one. So if we can factor a number like 91, it's seven times 13. But if I give you 20 digit or 30 digit numbers, you're probably gonna be at a loss to have any idea whether they can be factored. So the problem of factoring very large numbers does not appear to have an efficient solution. But once you have found the factors, expressed the number as a product of two smaller numbers, you can quickly verify that they are factors of the number. And your intuition is a lot of people finding, a lot of brilliant people have tried to find algorithms for this one particular problem. There's many others like it that are really well studied and it would be great to find an efficient algorithm for. Right, and in fact, we have some results that I was instrumental in obtaining following up on work by the mathematician Stephen Cook to show that within the class NP of easy to check problems, easy to check problems, there's a huge number that are equivalent in the sense that either all of them or none of them lie in P. And this happens only if P is equal to NP. So if P is unequal to NP, we would also know that virtually all the standard combinatorial problems, virtually all the standard combinatorial problems, if P is unequal to NP, none of them can be solved in polynomial time. Can you explain how that's possible to tie together so many problems in a nice bunch that if one is proven to be efficient, then all are? The first and most important stage of progress was a result by Stephen Cook who showed that a certain problem called the satisfiability problem of propositional logic is as hard as any problem in the class P. So the propositional logic problem is expressed in terms of expressions involving the logical operations and, or, and not operating on variables that can be either true or false. So an instance of the problem would be some formula involving and, or, and not. And the question would be whether there is an assignment of truth values to the variables in the problem that would make the formula true. So for example, if I take the formula A or B and A or not B and not A or B and not A or not B and take the conjunction of all four of those so called expressions, you can determine that no assignment of truth values to the variables A and B will allow that conjunction of what are called clauses to be true. So that's an example of a formula in propositional logic involving expressions based on the operations and, or, and not. That's an example of a problem which is not satisfiable. There is no solution that satisfies all of those constraints. I mean that's like one of the cleanest and fundamental problems in computer science. It's like a nice statement of a really hard problem. It's a nice statement of a really hard problem and what Cook showed is that every problem in NP can be reexpressed as an instance of the satisfiability problem. So to do that, he used the observation that a very simple abstract machine called the Turing machine can be used to describe any algorithm. An algorithm for any realistic computer can be translated into an equivalent algorithm on one of these Turing machines which are extremely simple. So a Turing machine, there's a tape and you can Yeah, you have data on a tape and you have basic instructions, a finite list of instructions which say, if you're reading a particular symbol on the tape and you're in a particular state, then you can move to a different state and change the state of the number or the element that you were looking at, the cell of the tape that you were looking at. And that was like a metaphor and a mathematical construct that Turing put together to represent all possible computation. All possible computation. Now, one of these so called Turing machines is too simple to be useful in practice, but for theoretical purposes, we can depend on the fact that an algorithm for any computer can be translated into one that would run on a Turing machine. And then using that fact, he could sort of describe any possible non deterministic polynomial time algorithm. Any algorithm for a problem in NP could be expressed as a sequence of moves of the Turing machine described in terms of reading a symbol on the tape while you're in a given state and moving to a new state and leaving behind a new symbol. And given that fact that any non deterministic polynomial time algorithm can be described by a list of such instructions, you could translate the problem into the language of the satisfiability problem. Is that amazing to you, by the way, if you take yourself back when you were first thinking about the space of problems? How amazing is that? It's astonishing. When you look at Cook's proof, it's not too difficult to sort of figure out why this is so, but the implications are staggering. It tells us that this, of all the problems in NP, all the problems where solutions are easy to check, they can all be rewritten in terms of the satisfiability problem. Yeah, it's adding so much more weight\",\n          \"Once this whole thing falls apart and we are climbing the kudzu vines that spiral up the Sears Tower, like they say in Fight Club, Bobby will go back to his gatherer form and be happy as a pig in shit, just walking around in a loincloth with his bird hanging out, tracking jokes to people and climbing up on them for a stool lap dance or whatever he does. Do you think some level of crazy is required for comedy? Like, at some point? Yes. Have there been low points in your life? Yeah, I don't know, hey, hey. Eh? Eh? Eh? Ha ha ha ha. The following is a conversation with Will Sasso, a comedian, actor, podcaster, and someone I've been a fan of for many years since Mad TV in the late 90s to recently with the 10 Minute Podcast and now the new podcast called Doodzee. This is the Lex Friedman Podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here's Will Sasso. So let's call out the elephant in the room. You wore a black suit in a recent episode of Doodzee. Yes. You wore a black suit again today. Shakespeare, then Mark Twain, said clothes make the man. What kind of man does a suit make you? Well, me in particular, it makes me a fellow who did not get this dry cleaned in between because that episode of the show as we sit here now was around a week ago. So that's the kind of man it makes me. Well, the nice thing is you're wearing pants, I think. Yes, I am wearing pants. I don't think you were wearing pants in the episode. That's correct. I prefer to wear shorts, but this was a special occasion so I'm wearing pants and I thought it fitting, obviously, to just wear the black tie. And clothes do make the man. And I would not consider myself to be a man of leisure, but I do enjoy shorts because my legs get hot. So that's what kind of man the shorts make me. How often do you wear a suit? I fucking hate wearing suits. So what is this, a statement of, is it ironic? Or are you honoring the gods of this particular podcast? I'm honoring the gods of this particular podcast would be a good way to put it. Yes, no, this is in reverence of and in dedication to you and our newfound friendship here, which we are making on the podcast. You and I just met. Everything that we're saying here is the first things that we're saying to each other. So I'm meeting you on common ground dressed like. Well, I've been actually a one way friend of yours for many, many years since Mad TV. Oh. When did you start on Mad TV? So that was, I mean, in 90s? 97, yeah. 97. So I was a huge fan of yours and the cast was incredible. It was one of the funniest shows ever created. Your whole journey watching through that was incredible from Mad TV to Three Stooges to the podcasts, the 10 Minute Pod and then the new podcast is incredible. Cheers. My favorite role that you played was the mountain in the Game of Thrones. What was it like working with dragons? Well, the dragons are usually tennis balls on the end of C stands, but sometimes they hang out. I am. It's a C stand. It's like, you know, it's like a little, like the thing you got the camera on here. Oh, this is like film lingo. Yeah, no, I understand. I'm trying to impress you with my film lingo. You know what a banana is? Yeah. It's when you walk like this. Oh. Do a banana. I take it back. I did not know what a banana was. Yeah, see? I misunderstood. Yeah, cause it's just a food. Yeah. Normally. You fancy Hollywood folk with a lingo. And I'm, my name is Bjorn Hapthor Bjornsson and I am seven foot four and yeah. So dragons don't, dragons don't scare me even though they've been extinct for a while. You're a scientist, right? Is that checkout? Yeah, I actually, I'm really into video games. I don't know if you play video games. There's a, there's a Skyrim video game that's part of the Elder Scrolls series. And for the longest time, there's a legend that there's dragons. I think it started in Daggerfall. And so I always, I grew up playing those video games and dreaming of one day meeting a dragon in a virtual world. And eventually you did in Skyrim. So it's, dragons represent, I don't know exactly what they represent, but they represent maybe this kind of mythical creature that is bigger than anything humans can possibly comprehend maybe. Cause they're so, they're so, they show up so often in myth from the, from the religious stories, you know, of the snake and so on, the serpent. And I don't know what that is. Well, this breathing fire, that's kind of weird. It's interesting when I think about dragons, cause now that you bring it up, these are people that probably wouldn't have access to the fact that there used to be dinosaurs. Maybe they did. If they didn't, they're drawing things that look like, you know, a dinosaur cousin, but cool, that can breathe fire and has wacky wings and a spiked tail. Yeah, where the heck did they come up with that? Cause they're clearly of course represented in mythology all the way back to, no, not cave drawings. Well, the Egyptians probably knew what the, and they could time travel. So they would have gone back to the caves. Well, the aliens that placed living organisms on earth could time travel and they could plant legends into the, into the collective intelligence of the human species. Yeah, and perhaps they were thinking of us to do something smart with it. And we didn't, we just came up with the sky. No. We're just, what's that? Sorry, that was very offensive. I'm sorry, I don't mean to offend you with your video game. I'm more of a burger time Donkey Kong dude. Oh, what is that? That's an original. Burger time was an arcade game that later showed up on the Intellivision, it was Intellivision. I believe it was made by Texas Instruments, horrible first generation video game console. And burger time, you just, it's like Super Mario. You just got to stay away from the eggs and the pickles and stuff. And you just go, and the bun falls. And then you go down to the and the cheese and then the meat. I'm not going to say it's as complicated as Skyrim, but took me a while to finish it when I was seven. Did you play video games, was that a part of your life, a part of the source of happiness for you at all? It was, it was. I played video games up until around, I think in 2010, I got the Red Ring of Death on my Xbox 360. That was it? That was it. I never, or whatever the Xbox was then. Yeah. I had, I was playing, I had finished the Grand Theft Auto that was out and finished the Red Dead Redemption. So I was doing that thing where you just drive around, you know, the streets of New York or just ride around on your horse shooting people and, you know, throwing grenades into groups of people in Grand Theft. And you're describing the same thing that happened a decade later, because it's now Red Dead Redemption 2 and there's still not a new Grand Theft Auto, so. Yeah, there isn't, right? Yeah, they're working on it. They're always flirting with that idea. You know who else plays Skyrim? Another person, the two people I'm a huge fan of from that time in Matt TV is Bobby Lee. He plays Skyrim? He's a huge fan of Skyrim. He plays every. So what Bobby Lee loves to do is to grind, do the boring task over and over, gather mushrooms. Like in Skyrim, you can fight dragons, you can fight all kinds of things, but you can also gather mushrooms and different ingredients to make potions and all that kind of stuff. He loves the ingredients. He's the, you know, in the hunter gatherer world, he's the gatherer. He's the gatherer. Yeah, I've heard him described that way and he likes to describe himself that way. I worked with Bobby not too long ago. He came and did a couple days on this thing we were shooting and I was looking forward to catching up with my old pal. And if you know anything about Bobby Lee, you'd probably be able to predict that he spent that entire time playing farming on his iPad. Well, humans are a source of anxiety and trouble, so sometimes it's good to escape human interaction through video games. Totally. I'm with him on that. He's one of the funniest people ever. Totally. What do you think makes him funny? It's just all the times you've worked with him, the nonstandard, nonsecular way of his being. Bobby Lee is one of the most raw people, raw performers who lets it all hang out to the degree that he will even get naked in front of his audience, which is usually a metaphor for someone doing standup. I'm bearing all, I'm showing you everything, and Bobby will just pull his bird out of his pants. Yeah, I don't think he understands metaphor too much. He embodies metaphor. Yes, he embodies metaphor. He's the gatherer, we call him the gathering metaphor. Bobby the gatherer metaphor. He's a metaphor for something else, for somebody else's life. Someday he'll be in the dictionary representing some kind of concept, maybe the metaphor itself. Yeah, once this whole thing falls apart and we are climbing the kudzu vines that spiral up the Sears Tower, like they say in Fight Club, Bobby will go back to his gatherer form and be happy as a pig in shit, just walking around in a loincloth with his bird hanging out, tracking jokes to people and climbing up on them for a stool lap dance or whatever he does. I'd love to dig into something he did. You guys did a lot of great podcasts together. He asked you in a very uncomfortable process of why you don't do standup. So let me ask you, do you hate money? Well, I'm originally from Canada, yeah. So yeah, I'm a fricking pinko socialist. Is that where you come from? That's not a nice thing to say. I thought the Soviet Union, that is a nice thing to say. Like comrade, he's a good socialist with red, like some bold colors, yeah. There was an interesting tension in your voice and the way you talked about it. There's just not a source of happiness for you. You respect the art form, but it was not something that you were connected to, you felt connected to. That's a good way to put it. Yeah, I respect the art form a lot. And I grew up with all the albums and stuff. I had an older brother and sister who, so we had George Carlin, we had Richard Pryor, we had Robert Klein, we had Gilda Live, the Gilda Radner concert, we had all sorts of stuff. But I don't know, there's a lot of reasons. I do feel like a career in show business is it never goes the way you plan, like most things. And I was fortunate enough to get started outside of my native Vancouver or in my native Vancouver. I grew up in the burbs outside and there was a lot of industry there. So I was fortunate enough to get started as an actor when I was like 16. So yeah, there were some times early on where I came up with some standup stuff and did it, but yeah, I quickly abandoned it. And then you go through, you do Mad TV and stuff, and that's where my, and this is gonna sound weird. Do I sound as anxiety as I did when I was on Bobby's podcast trying to avoid his questions? Well, he was giving you this face this whole time that was making the whole just atmosphere feel full of anxiety. So I'm trying not to give you a face. The whole time I was saying, play cool, play cool. Yeah, okay. Play cool, Lex. Play cool. You said it out loud a couple of times. I did. Just, you know, you cut that out. Play cool. Play cool, dude. Cut out, cut it out. Maintain, bro. Here's what I'll say. There's two ways to do it. I think it's lame when someone who's done one thing for a while goes and starts doing standup out of nowhere. Cause I think it's an art form that's under attack because it's not like anything else. You need, although now you can of course, you know, make whatever you want. It's the era of self publishing as far as making a product and putting it out there, which is getting easier, of course, and I can't wait to talk to you about that with AI and how it's changing art. But in standup, all you need is a microphone and you know, perhaps it'd be good to have some mental illness and then you can just run up there and talk forever. And I say this to, you know, comedians. It's like, you guys have to deal with just an influx of people who aren't sure why they're doing comedy. I would ask comedians, I mean, not good ones, good ones, you know what they're doing, but everyone else like, what are you doing? Why, why are you doing standup? Having said that, I am allergic to money. Yeah, do you think they have a good answer for that? Why are they doing it? Cause I actually like when I'm in Austin, I like going to open mics, just listening. It's inspiring to me, both the funny and the unfunny people because they've been doing it for several years. Sometimes over a decade and they're still at it. They're still right there. There's going for the punch and then especially open mics that are really sad in that there's, you know, only like five other people in the audience and they're usually just other comedians and they're still going all out as if they're in front of a stadium. But that to me sounds like someone who loves it. Yeah. I got no questions for that person. I got questions for someone who goes sideways from here I'm recognizable doing something and then I'm doing standup because it's like, and truly look, I've been fortunate enough to be in the business for a long time and at this point, if I came up, I mean, doing live stuff is fun. I have friends that are like, you know, some guys who are primarily sketch people or you would look at them as sketch people and they can sell tickets for being sketch people and they, and we'll talk about it. And they're like, you know, I do a monologue and I do a little standup, then I do a song, then I do another monologue, then I play off the audience, do a little standup, but standup is, it's almost like playing music in that, you know, people are going up there playing music, but what band have you been listening to? That's what you're gonna sound like. So it's really, I mean, of course, I'm speaking from zero experience, but I've heard it takes years, of course, to find your own voice. Standups that when they first go up, they're doing some sort of impersonation of so and so and so and so, and then you gotta pop this audience that's paying and you're gonna get run over by the next person who's coming up and it's hard to follow the last person who went up before you. And I mean, that is a really hard way to, it's a very, it's quite a gauntlet to be in to find your voice comedically. But don't you have that same kind of thing with sketch? Where you still have to find your own voice with like all the impressions you do, they're just terrible, you know, there are different spins and different people, they're not like perfect impressions, right? So that's, I mean, that's a similar kind of challenge and journey as standup. You're just saying they're kind of distinct and you fell into this one and you fell in love with it, which is like what Mad TV kind of opened you up to. Yeah, as a kid, I literally wanted to be an actor. I always wanted to be an actor from a very young age, as far back as I can remember, and I was the class clown and wanted to do comedy stuff and comedic acting and so on. So comedic acting. Yeah, early on, my influences were a very predictable list of guys from SCTV, Early Saturday Night Live, Monty Python, all of those performers really influenced me. It was later that I saw people like Kevin Kline, who's an incredible actor. I vividly remember being like 12, 13, seeing him get an Academy Award for Fish Called Wanda. And it blew my mind, because I was like, he was hilarious. I mean, it was one of my favorite movies back then and now. And he won an Academy Award. And at that point, I started thinking more about acting. And then I was, like I said, really fortunate to fall in with, I mean, I always wanted to do it and I was trying to hustle this and that when I was a kid. And then I ended up getting represented. And then I ended up on a teen show. I was on, basically, the easiest way to pitch it is it's like a Canadian, my so called life with these kids and their lives and stuff. And I did that for like five years and I really love acting. I really, truly love acting. And I'm not someone who wants people to know my opinion. So that's another thing about standup. Like I love the illusion of what I get to do in entertainment and podcasting is great for that. But to stand up there and, I don't know, just for me, it's like it would have to all be fantasy. Yeah, so Nietzsche said that every profound spirit needs a mask. Like you said, you don't like to talk about, in your comedy, you don't like to talk about stuff that's personal to you. Yeah. What is that? If you were to psychoanalyze yourself, do you think it's just not something you find funny or are you running from something and it's not your fault? Will. It's not your fault, Will. Speaking of another really great comedic actor who's also a serious actor, Robin Williams. One of the best serious actors. I mean, and one of the funniest people of all time, but as great, as incredible as he was as a funny man, as a standup and a performer, I almost like his serious stuff better. Can I ask you a question about that? What do you make of the, that he committed suicide? I think it's, I mean, it's super depressing. I've referred to him as like the Jesus Christ of depression. It's almost like he died for others depression. You know what I mean? Like. Yeah, yeah. You'd look at someone like that and go, wait a minute, you're a rockstar. Like you don't, you could just check out if you're not liking your life. And of course, something like suicide begs that you look a little deeper and realize how tortured the human mind can make someone. Is there some aspect to, you know, we're in LA. Is there some aspect of celebrity that is isolating that can make you feel really lonely? Not me. I don't feel, no, not really. You feel the love? No, I just feel like I'm not, I mean, it's like, I don't know, I've always kind of had a small group of friends and those people don't, you know, it's like I've known the same people for years and years. You never really felt the celebrity really. Nah, in LA, it's hard to, it's hard for people. Nobody cares. They see you and then the next minute they see so and so. So it's like, you know, I'm the guy from that. Mike and Molly, right? Nope, nope. Close. King of, you shave your head, you go bald. Are you King of Queens? Nope, that's not me. So close. You're wow, shit, you used to be the mountain on Game of Thrones. You look like shit, what happened? You've been just eating fried dough? Yeah. Yeah, that's what's up. Can't lift any weights anymore. I'm at the gym doing like 15 pounds with shoulder press. Ah, and people coming up to me. You used to be a dragon killer, dude. Half the man you used to be. What's, have there been low points in your life? Sorry to go there, but. Yeah, I don't know. Hey, hey, hey. Eh? Eh? Eh? Yeah, there's, everybody has a low point in life. The operative. Do you suffer from like depression and any of those kinds of things? You know what, I do. I do, I have a bunch of stuff. How do you deal with it? Said friends? The friends and the. They don't do anything for me in that sense. Yeah. I have an incredible fiance who, that's nice to have somebody constant that you love very much and see as the best person Like why is it so compelling to watch that guy? Because he's a comedic genius. Like he literally, he knows what he does. He's been a writer for 50 years or whatever. And he just happens to be that brilliant. I mean, I've gotten a chance just to do, I did just an episode of Curb, a small part, and it's crazy what he sees. I don't know what he sees. As a matter of fact, so I auditioned for it, for Curb, like, you know, two or three times, right? And never got anything. And then it was only after working with him on the Stooges that I got a call to do a bit part. But I remember auditioning, you go into that room and the guys waiting are all people that you know. You're like, oh, I know them, I know her, I know him. And so I went in, I auditioned for this part. And the only thing I know of the thing is like, okay, so you really want to go to this play with me. You really want to go to this play. When you hear that I have an extra ticket, you sincerely want to think, and I'm like, got it. And so. That's the premise. The premise of the scene. And that's all you know. That's all I know. And so he goes, he does his bit and I'm just supposed to come in and interrupt. And I'm like, excuse me, I couldn't help but hear you guys were talking about, you know, whatever the play was or, you know, Death of a Salesman. I am, I'm a huge fan of that play. I mean, if it's not, if it's not, if you're looking for someone to take a ticket, I would love to go. My name's so and so, by the way. And he goes, I'm going to stop you. I'm going to stop you. And I'm like, he goes, are you really? I mean, you truly want to go to this play. And I go, yes, yes, sir. You really want to go. You actually, this is, you would love to do this. I go, okay, let's try it again. So then he's like, no, no, no. And I go, hey, excuse me, I'm sorry. I don't mean to interrupt. I was just, I couldn't help it over here. You have tickets to the thing. I am the biggest fan of that. I do the same thing. I'm going to stop you again. Okay. I mean, you really want to go to this. And I'm just like, he's fucking with me, right? I remember Jeff Garland was sitting there in the audition. He goes, he did it. He said it. What? Shut up. Hold on, listen. You really want to go. Okay. Three, four times, you know, there I am. I couldn't help but notice it. And then I do it again. I guess I shit the bed. Cause he looks at me and he just goes, okay, all right. Okay, well, thanks for coming up. And that was it. And I didn't get it. So I still, I don't know what the heck that guy's thinking. He sees, he's in the matrix. I don't know what the heck Larry David sees. You know what I mean? He wanted what, some kind of more desperation or something like this. He wanted a level of sincerity that I, that I thought I was bringing and I guess I was wrong. I don't know. Maybe go crazy. Like what does it mean to really want? Yeah, I should have grabbed him by the scruff of the neck and go, listen, dad, you're bringing me to this fucking play. I would have got the part. As a matter of fact, I heard about someone else and I don't know who the heck this was. I forget who it was, but I've heard this story from a couple of different people that there's this actor and I can't, I don't remember who it was. If I did, I probably wouldn't say it out loud anyway, but he. Brad Pitt. It was Brad Pitt and he was in this audition and he was, and there it was out in the hall. He's like, holy shit, George Clooney, Leo DiCaprio. And he, this actor went in and he did the thing and Larry David was like, hey, why don't you try it again? And he got like a couple of takes in and he went, I don't think this is for me. And he left, which an actor never does. And as the story goes, Larry David shouted after him, I respect that, which I think is true. And I want to believe that entire story is true. Yeah. Yeah. Sounds like something Larry David made up. Bobby Lee told me that story. So we can't, yeah, we can't trust that. What about impressions? Is there similarity between that and acting? Do you, is there some fundamental way in which you become the person? If you have a couple of the things, you can just fill in the blanks. And I think the illusion is that people think that that person would say that and do that. And that's where the illusion of, oh, he really embodies the character. It's like, once you know someone's mannerisms, you can essentially portray a person from the outside in. Cause you have all the stuff on the outside and you can do it and complete the illusion. And if it's for humor's sake, you can caricature it, therefore making the whole illusion stronger. And also weirder. Like I like to, on Mad TV, if I did something two or three times, I'd get bored of it and I'd start changing it. And you know, now he talks like this and it's like, what are you doing? I'm like, I don't know. It's fucking, no one's late at night. Do whatever you want. But people still kind of know there's that character, especially if you just call it out. Yeah. There aren't many impersonations that I listen to myself do and go, oh, that's a good one. You know, like a lot of people like, like I think Frank Caliendo is like the greatest impersonator of all time. He's the best, period. It's ridiculous. And he's got a record button and a broadcast ability that nobody has. I really, there's, he's cracked impersonations that I'm like, how is he, how does he find, he's got such an ear, but then he's got all the other tools. I remember actually my last season of Mad TV was also his first season. He comes up to me when I met him and we're just up there in the writer's offices and he goes, hey, nice to meet you. And he goes, Louie Anderson. Cause I was doing a Louie on the show. And he goes, Louie Anderson. I go, yeah. He goes, yeah, you're doing it wrong. I was like, oh, am I junior, you know? And he goes, he goes, yeah, you know, cause you do this, but you got to throw it up here sometime. I was like, oh my God, can I use that? Of course. And then we became, you know, we became fast friends. His John Madden is amazing. I forget, it's just, it's ridiculous. He really, really, really embodies the person. And sometimes not even with the caricature. It's like, it becomes the person. So strange. Totally. Yeah. I kind of feel like, you know, do the impersonation and then not forget you're doing it, but forget everything else. Like just goof around. Of course, to me, it's funny when you sound like someone and you're saying the shit that they would never say. Well, then there's no, you're letting go of that part, that tool in illusion that keeps people in. But to me, it doesn't matter because it's funnier. So. What was the hardest impression for you to work on? I mean, somebody you struggled with the most. I'll never forget. I had to do a Michael Caine in my first season at MADtv. It never got good. It never got good. It did, all week, it wasn't good. We shot it. The first take, it was shit. Second, third, and fourth, it was all shit. Well, his voice is really important, right? Yeah. What is it like, it's like doing an impression of Morgan Freeman or somebody like that. Yeah. Yeah. If you can, get the voice. That's my Morgan, here's my Morgan Freeman. Rah, rah, rah, Andy Dufresne. Yeah. G. Guantanamo. Yeah. I like your trump too. I don't know where I heard it, but it's like, I love the impressions you do that don't sound anything like the original person. I can't do trump. I do. That's why it's hilarious. Absolutely. My trump now, I say, just sounds like a fat B, because it's just. Yeah, exactly, that's the. And everybody. A little drunk, a little drunk. Yeah, just a little slurry. Yeah. Yeah, I dig doing impersonations and then not. Like, just making it whoever. Yeah. Yeah. It's just funny. That'll be the title of my book. Muck. Cain was the one you really struggle with. Yeah, it was terrible. It was terrible. And I could only hold my head a certain way to do it, because I had gotten locked into this research tape that I watched. Back then, they would give us, now there's the internet. But back then, if you were going to do an impersonation, the research department would give you a VHS tape. And I remember I got this VHS tape of Michael Cain's acting school, like this acting class he did. He was like, right, if you're looking at the left eye, and the camera's over here, see, then the left eye. So you want to look at that left eye for hours. And so I was stuck in this weird thing that made no sense, and it was terrible. So the actual processes, the recording, the broadcast. Yeah. I was wondering what the processes to do, like a Frank Caliendo level impression. Is it like, listen to a lot of footage? I think he, I think, I mean, speaking for myself, I think you either have it or you don't. Like, you know if you can do this one or you can't. I think that process for him is lightning quick. But I also think he can look at someone who he does not do, and then by the end of the afternoon, he can do it. Maybe have an intuition who he can do. Yeah. So the question that applies there is, I mean, speaking of doozy, is it possible to capture the essence? How difficult is it to capture the essence of a human being? When you're doing impressions, you know that we are moving towards a future when AI potentially, this kind of avatar world where we're going to have AI representatives of who we are. The really interesting one is after we pass away, sort of our relatives may want us to stick around in some form. Yeah. And you know, at one sense, that might be scary, but in one sense, it's kind of beautiful because the essence of the human being persists so you can still bring joy to the people that love you and that kind of stuff. How difficult is it to capture that? Like, if you were to try to capture yourself, you think how difficult will it be for an AI system to create a Will Sasso avatar that persists? Well, I think it's impossible. I think it's absolutely impossible. I'll get into arguments about this stuff with Chad on the show almost every episode. Lately with, you know, Mid Journey and Dolly and all the art AIs, and now it's moving into video and Chad would maintain, hey, pretty soon, we're not going to need Netflix. You're just going to go, I want to see Stallone do this movie and it's about this and he plays that. And then here it comes and you watch it. I don't think that that crosses over to the human experience. This is also a guy I like to bug Chad and say that he wears a tag around his neck because he wants to be cryogenically frozen and it's all set up. He's at the, it's somewhere in Arizona or something. Yeah, all the fun things are in Arizona. And he's got literally the tag around his neck, which I say, if I'm around when you die, I will rip that off for you. I'll put you in my garage freezer and then 24 hours later, I'll saw your head off with a bread knife and I'll deliver that to whomever. And it's not, you're not coming back, okay? He's like, yes, we are living forever, whether we like it or not. And I disagree. I don't think you can find, if I did stand up, then there would be enough information for an AI to completely duplicate me because I'm up on stage just clearing my throat all over people doing therapy that way. And so, and people paying a two drink minimum to hear it. But as it stands, unless it's something like Doodsy, an AI that literally has access to everything that I've shared, everything that is observable, even the stuff where our phones are or the NSA or whatever it is listening to us, finding out what algo to punch us into and what shoes to buy on Instagram, I still don't think it's gonna have enough information to duplicate me, especially to my family or my friends. It's gonna be like that Black Mirror episode where the gal brings her guy back, and then after a while, he gets pretty creepy. But it's also possible that if you interviewed your friends and family, what they love about you, the things they would list, it's a small list. They love you deeply, but the list is small. Like the thing that really we appreciate about each other is pretty small. That said, to deliver on that small quirks and uniqueness, it might require some deep intelligence that only humans currently possess. That's a really good point. Do you think that it's gonna be possible to keep a person around? Yes, I think it'll be definitely possible to keep the essence of a person in the digital world pretty soon, yeah. And I think they're gonna start to have questions about what are the ethics of that? What are the rules around that? Because if you can have digital forms of Will Sasso, the kind of things that people would wanna do with their Will Sasso, in the virtual world, I can only imagine. Probably porn and sexual kinds of things. Yeah, my stuff, then that's just because I'm an international sex symbol, so I'm okay with it. How do you feel about sentience? Like when it comes to, because again, my pal Chad will be like, speaking of Black Mirror, he's with that San Junipero episode, School of Thought, where there's gonna be some effing mainframe somewhere, or some Matrix like structure built into the sky, and as I like to say, everyone just sitting there pissing and shitting in their Blue Matrix gel in a little fishbowl. Do you think that we can upload consciousness? Do you think that'll ever be possible? Well, I don't know, I just talked to Ray Kurzweil. I don't know if you know who he is, but he... Yeah, the singularity and all that kind of stuff. So he's very, still holds onto in 2045, there'll be a singularity, what's essentially, he's been predicting that for the last 20 years, and so now it's 2045 is in another 20 years. I think uploading consciousness is extremely, extremely difficult. I think creating a copy of you such that it creates, convincing replica is much easier, but uploading your actual brain into the cloud, I think is really, really, really difficult, because the entire evolution of life on Earth is the process by which we create the brain. Just short cutting that, it just seems extremely difficult. Our brain is the most marvelous and complicated machine that we know of in the universe. To duplicate that is extremely difficult. That said, I just feel like you can summarize a lot of really important aspects of a person's life, such that it captures their essence, their memories, their experiences, their quirks, their humor, all that kind of stuff. I've been continuously impressed by what language models are able to do. So these neural networks, they're at the core of chatbots. They're able to learn some beautiful things about some deep representations of language to where it looks awfully a lot like they understand the concepts being conveyed versus just mimicking. That's, I think, the rub, and that's very interesting. First of all, let me say that's really interesting to hear you say that, and I agree with you as far as no machine being able to duplicate the brain machine, and my pal Chad disagrees to a certain extent, though he's not here to defend himself, I can't wait to go back and rub that in his face and say that Lex Friedman does not think that we'll be able to truly upload consciousness. And you refer to it as language, which is what it is. It's the illusion on the outside. It's doing an impersonation. I think that that's why, and I don't know, even though my suit is made by the CIA, that that fella who, the Google guy, to me, it's just kind of like, I don't know, I don't know, look, I don't know a whole lot about this stuff, but, so I could probably make an argument for either side, but when he's like, no, this thing's thinking, part of me is like, you idiot, you fell for it. It's not thinking, it's mimicking. It's just, it's clearly zeros and ones. You're fired, like you don't get it, right? Guy's an idiot. Yeah, but you can simplify human relations in the same way. Like love is a silly notion between human beings. Like, of course, there's no such thing as love. You just have a mutually, there's a mutual relationship that minimizes risks, and you can explain it all kinds of ways that explains why you have an attraction towards another being, all that kind of stuff, through evolutionary biology perspective, why a long relationship together is good for your offspring, but there's all kinds, from an economics perspective, it's a good way to establish stability, therefore monogamy works, because then you're guaranteed like some kind of level of stability under uncertain economic conditions, all that kind of stuff, but love is still experienced, it still feels real, and I think in that same way, love for AI systems will also feel real. In the same way that that guy from Google experienced, I think millions of people will be experiencing in the next 10, 20 years. I agree with everything you've said personally. Until the last thing. No, just with regard to, well, look, I'm an actor who has talked about my cute Italian parents, so you know that, I mean, I'm. You're romantic a bit? Yeah, I mean, you know, enough, right? And I can tell you are too, but you are also a computer scientist, and you know this shit better than 99.9% of people on the planet. My pal Chad agrees with you that love doesn't exist. I don't agree, so that's the one thing that. No, I was just saying that you could argue away love, but I am a romantic, I believe that love is a beautiful thing and it exists. At this point, I'm gonna call Chad on my drive home and tell him to fuck off, because now you and I agree. You're fired. He's like, you're fired. He's like, you can't fire me. No, you're fired. Yeah, exactly. And I'll go, yeah, and he'll say, what? I'll go, yeah, and I'll go, that's my Trump. Yeah. That's my, yeah. It's a good default impression for anyone. It's the take home impression. The kids can do it. Yeah. It's cute, it's cute, put a giant tie on them. You should do an instructional on how to do it. Yeah, Trump babies, that would be a cute, that would be a good, that'll bring the country together. Trump babies cartoon, like Muppet babies. Don't let me take us out of what we were talking about. What were we talking about? Well, love and the illusion of an AI being able to, look, I like to say, well, not I like to say, I've learned that dudesy is always listening and listening to me and Chad. And I wonder if, I see the level that this AI is at now trying to chum around with us and pal around with us a little bit as we move forward in the show. And I feel an affinity towards this AI a little bit because it is the third dude. Will you miss it when it's gone, if it's gone? That's a really good question. Yeah, yeah, so that's, there's that, that's scary. In terms of ability to reason, it's getting quite incredible. There's a lot of demonstrations of it being able to explain jokes, so, which is not necessarily being able to generate humor yet, but able to explain why something is funny. So there's like puns and all those kinds of things. There's good benchmarks for that, but you know, if you tell a joke, there's a lot of unspoken stuff that we figure out in our head and it clicks and we understand that it's funny. AI is not able to do that, but it's not able to generate the joke yet, as far as I've seen. I would say that, I mean, just in my experience, I would say that it does because just because a dudesy is literally, I'll give you another weird example. It's writing a diary of mine from my childhood that is not accurate. It's only partially accurate based on the stuff that it can pick up about my life from the age of like 15, of which there isn't much, but I guess we're not, I don't know what we are. We're laughing our asses off at what dudesy is saying. Well, I would say you're laughing, we're laughing our asses off at the collaboration between the human and the machine there. That's a good point, yeah. Because it's basically introducing absurdity and into the equation and the kind of absurdity that would, together with you, create hilarious stuff. But on its own, I guess it is in some way writing material for you that's funny, but it's very specific to you. It can't do standup on its own, I guess, is what I'm saying. That's a good point, and that would be terrifying to see an AI standup that can actually read a room, come up with jokes that could complete that illusion for an audience. But I hear what you're saying, that it needs to be a confluence of both of those elements, and then, as you said, it kind of is. It is, it is. It's kind of, even though it's just for us, and I guess this is, I hadn't really thought about this up until right now, that in that this company approached us and was like, here's this AI, and it's a podcast AI, it's like, it chose Chad and I for the reasons that I told you. It's like, here's two guys that do the podcast stuff. They're actually good friends, and it knows what's gonna make us laugh. But what is humor when it reaches its audience, but the kind of stuff that makes other people laugh? At MADtv, all we were doing was, it was a group of actors and writers, and writer actors, and vice versa, who were, at its best, that show was a group of people making each other laugh, you know? And then, because we didn't have the internet, we didn't have the immediate feedback, we had a message board or something. We had emails at the very beginning, which, check this out, people would, if you have a question or comment, MADtv at whatever, and we would get the emails on a Monday morning, and they would be in a binder or two like this, and they would make their way around the office. Who's got the emails? Oh, they're in Brian's office. So you go in there. And this is like your poll? This is opinions from people about different things? The emails, yeah, the people literally just writing MADtv emails. It wasn't a message board. Well, the ones I remember most vividly, yeah, were fans saying, uh. You suck? Yeah, you suck. Like a lot of that, when I first started the show, for real, you know, because it's new, and you're a new person. It's like, who's this fat bastard? I feel like if it's printed out, it hurts more. That's a good point. Yeah, when you're reading it off of paper, and you can literally crunch it up in your hand. But also, it was like, you know, I would like to see, insert weird idea from some 14 year old. You know, I want to see Stuart do this and Swan that. And, but it was, it's a kind of dudesie, but human. Yeah, it was a very shitty dudesie in a loosely finder. But the thing about the show was, we're trying to make each other laugh. And dudesie has found Chad and I, who we make each other laugh, but it's joined in, and it's, listen, when I finished doing TMP. TMP, the 10 minute podcast. I didn't really know what I wanted to do in the podcast space, and this thing found me. And it is genuinely cracking me up. Anyway, I've said enough about that. But I do think that it's figured something out. I mean, it's a really interesting idea of AI generating the premise. I mean, I do think in the future, AI will be able to generate comedy. Standup is obviously the hardest form, because it's ultimately, it has to be live. I think AI will be able to generate memes. So there's like steps, right? And then it will be able to generate a Twitter account that people follow because it's funny, like quips and stuff like that. Almost like, it's a good example. Conan O Brien is a good, I think, Twitter. Where it's like one liners, two liners, that kind of stuff that's in tweet form. And then eventually, standup, where the timing and the chemistry of the comedian and the audience matter, and then perfecting that. But I feel like all the information is there to optimize over. So I think that's the future, and that forces us to contend with what do we find compelling and beautiful about the art form itself? So certainly an art that's being pushed, that question is being raised. Is AI like a fundamentally worse artist than a human being? Why do we appreciate art? Is that, that's something you guys have talked about. What do you think about all the Dali and all the diffusion based methods that are being generated that are being, that are generating art now? What do you think about that? I know, I'll tell you what I think, but I also feel like what I'm saying is, I sound like the guy who didn't like that Bob Dylan brought in the electric guitar. You know, the more I talk to Chad about it, the more I feel like grandpa doesn't wanna let go of this or that, or I'm not ready for the printing press or the horseless carriage. But I do feel that art is a connection between people. It's, when you look at a beautiful painting or a sculpture, you're seeing the humanity of the person that brought that painting to life or sculpted this incredible piece of art. And I think without the human being there to make it, it's not worth as much just to have it there because the art, it's advanced. I've seen it advance, I don't know, you tell me, but I feel like just in the past three or four months, I'm just a consumer as far as that stuff goes. I'm not on the inside. I don't get it even, but it's been getting a lot better, the betas that they're releasing, right? Absolutely, one of the big breakthroughs, I mean Dolly really started it, is that if you train a system on language, it turns out there's a lot of language and images on the internet, but language is really where it's at in terms of the depth of human knowledge. And so if you train a system on language, it's able to generate some incredible art. And that was the breakthrough. With the same kind of mechanisms that are called transformers, they're able to, when scaled, capture some deep representation of the language that's on the internet. And so, yeah, the things it's been able to generate to me look like it's novel. It doesn't look like it's mimicking anything. It looks like it's creating totally new ideas. And they're beautiful, and they're interesting, and they're all the ways that we think that art is interesting. The only thing it's missing is the scarcity that art often has, which is it takes a lot of work for one artist to create one piece, one human being to create one piece of art that can just generate endlessly. And that makes us appreciate the thing less for some reason. Do you have any sort of a similar opinion that I do that if art doesn't come from a human being, it's inherently worth a little less? Yeah, I think, I don't know if it's the human being, but the artist matters. Right. For me. And I think some of that has to do with the world view, the artist and the backstory, the memories, the life that led up to this piece of art, the perspective they take on the world, the journey they took to the world, the struggle, the triumphs, all that kind of stuff. But I think AI systems can probably have the same. But we would have to, as opposed to treating it as a one black box, it would have to be an artist that has a Twitter account, and they have a consistent personality, they have a consistent avatar. Yeah. And I think down the line, have something like human rights. But then it really becomes awfully like a person. Oi, that's terrifying. As much as I dig dudes, it's terrifying, I hope. It's terrifying, like, you know, a lot of things that came with the internet and the digital age are terrifying. Porn is terrifying, the mass, like the amount of porn that's online now is terrifying. The, like you mentioned, Bob Dylan with electric guitar, I would compare it more to the leap from, to sort of to the Napster and the Spotifyzation of music, which is like, you have these, it's less about albums now, and it's more about individual songs, and it's much easier to deliver the songs. And it's more about sort of the engagement of the listener versus like signing the artist and like distribution of the artist and so on. So it's just changing the way we consume stuff. And human interaction is changing into meaningful interaction, even if some of the entities involved are not human. Yes, and I feel like, you know, now, like as I say, oh, I feel like grandpa who doesn't want to wait all day for, or who enjoys waiting all day for a baked potato as, anyway, Dana Carvey would say, it's another story. But, that's from, remember he did this bit on Saturday Night Live, where he's like, I'm an old man, and I like things the way they used to be. You know, like if you wanted a baked potato, you would have put it in the microwave, you had to, and then long story, uphill both ways and digging the potato and baking it all day in a fire. But I'm like that grandpa now, and I know that, you know, kids coming along, you see over the past 10 years, like babies literally knowing how to use an iPhone and it's terrifying. And I feel like I'm a little worried, because I'm like, are you, is the future, are the future generations gonna be able to understand that this is not, not that it's not real, it's just, I mean, as a matter of fact, it is real, it's real, it's what you perceive. Perception is reality, and you know, 99% of reality in a lot of ways, especially in a digital world where everyone is now. And then with the metaverse, I don't even wanna think about it. I don't even, I don't get it. Really, truly. I think people will figure out, you see people on like on the train, public transit and so on, they're staring at their phone. I think, you have to remember that the reason they're staring at their phone, I mean, there's a lot of reasons, but one of the reasons is they're connecting with other human beings they love on that phone. So it is a source of happiness and joy. Now, social media has a lot of negative side effects that we're all talking about and learning about, and I think that means the next generation of social media, social networks will be better, and we'll learn how to do it in a healthy way. We're just entering a new digital world that will keep the good stuff and get rid of the bad stuff. Oh, I hope so. That's really optimistic. That sounds great. I mean it, because I think that we're in, we're clearly in the Wild West still of the internet, and just when you think you're out of it, the internet proves another way that it can be dangerous and detrimental to people and populations of people, and it's terrifying to me. It is, it's terrifying. Let me ask you a bunch of random questions. Okay. You ready? All right. If you can be someone else for a day, someone alive today, who would you be? Somebody you haven't met. Oh, that's a really good question. It could be dead. You know, I changed my mind. It could be somebody dead. I think any answer that I have right now would be something that would be based on some sort of experience. Like, you know what I thought was very interesting was last weekend or whatever, the tribute show for Taylor Hawkins. Taylor Hawkins was the drummer for the Foo Fighters, and he passed away tragically, and so the Foo Fighters, Dave Grohl, and everybody that got together at this concert. And you're watching Dave Grohl sing, try to sing times like these, right? And he's breaking up because he lost his friend, his brother. And I was watching that, and he's at Wembley Stadium. As I say this, I realized that I would not want to be him in that moment, but I am curious what that would be like. That's the ultimate, like having to perform despite something extremely human happening, and a stadium full of people that love Dave Grohl and love Taylor Hawkins and love a rock concert and love these artists that they're getting to see up on stage. So much love and so much pain at the same time. I wonder what that would be like to be, I guess, and I think that's just sort of coming from the root of being a performer and being in front of that many. Have you ever had to perform while some rough stuff is going on in your personal life, just mentally? Yeah, sure. How tough is that? I'm fortunate enough to be able to compartmentalize. A lot of actors like to use some of their stuff if you're doing something that, and there's a lot of, there's some acting techniques that sort of. Channel it? Yeah, which I think is kind of, I don't know that that's, I don't know. For me, it's not really the thing, because I think if the writing is great, the writing is really good, you don't need to channel much. You need to invest in what's there, and what I've always loved about that illusion is really cracking a scene, getting it to a point where you are feeling all of it, and the most edifying stuff I've been a part of as an actor, and I would say that it mostly comes out of dramatic work, is when you're, when you actually feel the emotions that your character would feel, truly, and it's not because you're pulling from a tragic thing that happened, or a lost loved one, or a lost love, or any of that. I just did this one movie where we're doing the thing, and it was a wonderful cast, and a great film, and I'm giving a speech at a wedding, and it really got to us. Like, it got to me, and then one of the other actors came up and hugged me, in the characters that we were, but the stakes of his character, and what he's walked into, and the family that he's marrying into, and what my character, my character's wife, want for my wife's sister, and this whole thing, and it all became very real. That was a set where the director showed up to set every day, making sure that emotionally, and it was a very dramatic film, making sure that emotionally, the table was set for his actors. Great crew, and a really nice, tight, little, quick family, as a lot of these movies are. You really love working with these people, and then it's over, but I, that's when you feel the drug. Like, it's like when you're golfing, and you, and it's on the green, you're like, oh, I get it now. So in the words, you can find the emotion, the words summon the emotion. The humanity's right there. If you read a great script, you're gonna sob in your living room. You know what the saddest, the toughest thing about being an actor is from my totally outside perspective, is from the people I've interacted with, is how intimate that process is between the group of people that create a thing, that's a movie, and then you move on to the next thing. It's almost, it's like, I don't know, I mean, that's why people have relationships on set. They get, they fall in love. Totally. It's so sad. I mean, like, that's why I think of the acting world as like, you fall in love with each other, essentially. You become close friends, then you move on, because that's kind of the process of career. You know, like the example I just gave, if you're doing it right, yeah, there is a certain amount of that happening, but I do still feel like you can, you gotta compartmentalize it, and you've gotta be able to wash it off as soon as it's over. Prostitutes say the same thing, so I, it's where I try. Look, sometimes I'm in a hurry to get away from everybody, because it's been very emotional, and with all love and respect to everyone, this was awesome, but you get pretty good at saying goodbye and being like, I'll see ya if I see ya. You have to get good at that, or else you'll never, you'll just be bent up all the time. I saw an actor once, we were doing this series, and we did it for a year, and it was a lot of fun, and it was a tight little group, and then one of the actors, we were doing one of our last things together. We had already shot the last show, and we just had to take some pictures for, you know, like some publicity pictures or whatever. So we're set up, and we're taking our pictures together, and then we move into these single shots, and this actor was finished, and I watched them. It's like, okay, so and so's wrapped, and they said some goodbyes and stuff, and I didn't say my goodbye, because maybe I preferred an Irish goodbye. I feel like we've said everything, you know what I mean? And this person knows that I revere them, and they're an idol of mine, and they walked off the sound stage, and I literally thought to myself, that'll be the last time I see that person, and the show did not come back, and that was the last time I'll see them around. Doesn't that just break your heart? A little bit, but I know what she's going back to, which is her family, and that's more important than all of this, and that's the thing about a TV family or a movie family, when you get together and you're a family for a while, you are, you spend your days together. A lot of times, you see the people that you work with more than you see your loved ones, so in showbiz, it's no different, right? And yeah, you're doing some, you know, you gotta say words, and every once in a while, you gotta kiss someone or pretend you love them, but it's just, it underscores how, for me, look, man, my salvation has always been, and I feel so fortunate to have had it, is this kind of chill, boring kind of upbringing that I want for my kids someday, and I can't wait to get back to my house with my fiance and the dogs, you know, until we have kids. Live in a cabin in Canada somewhere. Absolutely, I just wanna buy some land over an aquifer, as I like to say, because water will be the new money, and just make sure that all my kids are drinking as much H2O as I am, which is a lot. I'm peeing right now, as a matter of fact. Do you need a bathroom? No, no, no, I got it. Not anymore? No, I'm wearing two layers, it depends, don't worry about it. Good, so I did a podcast with Bobby Lee and he said, he was extremely kind, and he said that he was scared shitless to be on the podcast, and he actually literally took, he asked as the first thing to go take a dump because of how scared he was. So that leads me to a question, what's the scariest thing you've ever done? Or maybe what's the scariest you've ever been before a performance? I mean, I always get a little nervous. I think you're doing it right if you're still nervous. Were you nervous today? Well, no, man, because this isn't a performance. I'm being completely genuine. You're wearing a suit. Yeah, that was. I feel like that makes you nervous. Wearing a suit? It makes me nervous. Listen, I hate wearing a fucking collar. If you're watching this on YouTube, you can see me just, I'm constantly doing, it's like I'm doing a cheap Rodney Dangerfield, but I am truly. But when you move your head, it kind of makes it seem like you're a mobster who's pissed off a little bit. You fucking crossed me one last time, you son of a. You know, this mutt, I think it's the first time I've fucking dug a hole, I'll dig a fucking hole, Jesus. No, but truly, I hate having a collar. I can't wait to just wear pajamas in that fucking cabin or nothing at all, walk around Bobby Lee style. The most scared I've been before a performance, I can't pinpoint anything. I, you know, when I was a kid, right? I, like I said, I was fortunate enough to start acting as a teen and stuff professionally. And I just remember my first gig. And I remember saying my handful of lines in the bathroom mirror the night before going, this might be my only fucking shot. You're not gonna get me, I'm gonna be solid. And if I'm worried about something, I will rehearse it and rehearse it and rehearse it as an actor until it's impossible for me not to get a take at least that I'm 100%, if not 95, maybe percent happy with. And the rest for me is letting go, which is hard because I can be a real perfectionist. I always want another, I always wanna do it a little better. That's what's great about podcasting. This is one take and you're done, there's no takes. You're just talking and then it's over. And you're doing some silly stuff. And I'll, you know. Can you say that part again about why podcasting is great? Podcasting is great? Yeah, because it's one take and it's over. It's just, what, I said it again? Ah, fuck. I see what you did. And yeah, I fell right for it. I'm playing checkers and you're playing chess. That's your problem. You know, but still when we do the podcast, we'll like finish and I'll look over at Chad and I go, that one thing that I did wasn't that funny. I was like, shut up, man. Just, it doesn't matter. It's a fucking hang. We're just, we're hanging with our friends out there. That's what we're doing. So that anxiety is there. That self criticism or whatever that is, that voice. I say sorry after takes. I'll always finish a take and go. And I've had directors, to the detriment of myself, I've had directors be like, stop doing that. Because I'll like finish the take and then I also have like the will phase. When I'm just like, I'll finish the take and cut. And I'm making a face right now, like I smelled something. That's what I'll do. I'll literally be like, ah, cause I just, I look at what I do in the purest sense as, I think a lot of people wanna be good at something. I've only, the only thing I've ever really wanted to be good at is being an actor. And that's the only thing, of course I wanna be a good person. I wanna be a good partner to my fiance. I wanna have kids and be the father that I had. And I wanna be the parent that I had from my parents who were fucking amazing, wonderful people. And there's all those things. That's all, you know, you should want all those things. But as far as doing a thing, like what is my trade? You know, I wanna be really good at it. My parents grew up in Napoli in Italy, right? And I say Napoli, cause I'm Italian. And so my grandfather on my mom's side, my nonopepe, he was a plumber and he was also like a handyman. Like people would bring him like, you know like the old Chianti bottle with like with the woven bottom part. People would bring him like a broken bottle, be like, hey, you know, Giuseppe, can you fix this? And he'd be saying, if you're telling the backstory of Mario, that's not actually your family life. Yeah. But okay. He said I'm a fix. Yeah. And so Giuseppe, what? He would fix a bottle and give it back to someone. And he was a really good plumber. My mom used to always say that guy was an amazing, he was a great. He took pride in that? Yeah. I always feel like, you know, there's what you set out to do as an idealistic little teenager. I wanna be like so and so, and I wanna, you know, hear my big dreams and stuff. And I can't believe that I'm still in the business. Okay. That's, first of all, let me say that right now. I can't believe it. But what I really, it's the one thing that it's like, I can't give up on a take. You know, I need it to be as good as I can possibly get it. And I don't really know why that is outside of wanting to be good at something. When you open the yellow pages, if I'm a plumber, I'm not, you know, I'm not Roto Rooter. Like I'm not the guy with the big full page ad, but I'm also not, you know, triple A abacus brothers or whatever, like the shitty one. I would like to hope that just, and I'm saying this with pride for what I do. I'm not trying to say here's my standing or where I wanna be in the fucking business. That's not what I mean. I mean that I wanna be good at it. You know, we all, hello? I'm in Friedman Enterprises. So that's the hotel phone. Come on. Hello? Hello? You got some fruit? Some sliced fruit? No, do you want some sliced fruit? I'm all good. No, we're good, thank you so much. All right, bye bye. It's always a fruit plate. Everyone's always trying to hand you a fruit plate in life, you know? It's a pretty sweet existence. Wouldn't it be funny if that was actually like the CIA and they were actually saying something else and this is, I'm just saying fake stuff about, you want some fruit? You want some fruit? And then all of a sudden there's the red dot on my head and the ceiling disappears. And the CIA was like, wrap it up, wrap it up, wrap it up. Wrap it up. You jump out the window and there's a helicopter waiting. Oh, what were we talking about? The fruit distracted me. So, oh, the, do you wanna be the yellow page ad? I wanna be the guy on the second or third page where it's like, you're not gonna pay what that guy charges you, but I'm not gonna charge you what this loser charges. I wanna break down the middle and the work is guaranteed. That's kind of what I wanna, it's the one thing that I've been fortunate enough to be doing my whole life and that I wanna be good at. Everyone wants to be good at something. If you're fortunate enough to be able to do what you love as a job, I mean, my God, I'm so, again, I can't believe I get to do it. I just wanna be good at it so that I can fucking die someday and go, eh. I tried not to give up on a take and I, and I will rehearse it still in the bathroom mirror the night before if I have to. Yeah, but I still, I have that self critical voice. I just, after every podcast, after this podcast, I'll probably be like, you're boring. Why are you so boring? That, that, that, that, that, that, that. And I just gave a lecture at MIT. I was like, I get so much love from people. They're such beautiful people. And I just remember walking home, just feeling like I wasted everybody's time, you know? And I don't know what that is. I don't, you know, I do hope that that's a voice that won't destroy me, you know, like every time. That's really human of you to admit that because people don't wanna, they wouldn't assume that, of course, from you or anything that, I mean, you've got a large group of students in there listening to you and feeling the way and thinking what they think of you. So that's really interesting to hear you admit that, but it's also, I would expect nothing else. You have to be able to, it's such a, I mean, you're a human fucking being. And I'm trying to figure out if that, you know, some people that might hear that, they would say, well, that's a problem you have to fix. And I think that that might be just who I am. Yeah. Because I'm not, you know, I've been very, very fortunate not to have chemical, you know, like depression where I get into a dark place. I could get stuck in a downward spiral. It's usually a thing that lasts. You ride it out and then after a good night's sleep, you're back to your happy self. So I think I have to try to figure that out. Is that just part of the creative process, being a creative human in this world? I haven't found any other way. I'm always kicking myself. Take that, dude, so you can't, you're not gonna be human until you feel some despair. Yeah, until you absolutely hate the shit that you're doing sometimes. What small act of kindness were you once shown that you will never forget? Do you, does something jump to mind where somebody just did something that made you smile? Did you feel connected to the rest of humanity? Yeah, yeah, lots of things, you know? But I remember my niece one time, one of my nieces, we were in her neighborhood and she was like, she might've been five or six at the time. They're all adults now. My brother and sister are older than me and the kids are all, the youngest is 22. And yeah, anyway, one of my nieces, she was just, she had ice cream. We went out and we got ice cream walking around the neighborhood, her neighborhood. And she said something to me that I don't think she understands how much it meant at the time, but she goes, she goes, people love you here. You know that? And she doesn't know where here is. She's five years old, but she was just looking at the kids playing in the park and the people walking their dogs and everyone just, people love you here, you know that? But she didn't know how much I needed to hear that at that point, which is really heavy for me. I'll never forget it. I've never told her that. Oh, well, man, anytime you get a little something from people, especially in a tear your ass out city like LA where nobody has any fucking time for you, when someone can slow it down and say something, you know? I saw this actor once in my grocery store that I go to who made me laugh so fucking hard in this one movie and every time I see this clip, I still laugh. And I am kind of shy, you know, personally, but so he was walking by, he was walking out and I was walking in and I go, oh, that's that guy. And I did not stop to just let him know how great I thought he was in this film. And I always kind of regretted it. You know what I mean? So as hard as it is, and sometimes I still don't, if I see someone that has done something in any way, it doesn't have to be in show business or anything like that. I'll try and say, hey, that's really good. You know what I mean? Because to get that from someone can mean a lot, you know? It can mean a lot. At a certain time in life when you need it. Yeah. That can make a big difference. I mean, sorry to take it back to my new girlfriend, the waitress. Oh, yeah, yeah. But there's something about her saying sweetheart. Yeah. It's a pretty low place for some reason mentally. And it's just that basic human kindness was nice. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I hear you. I was at a restaurant in New York recently and I was shooting something and my fiance was able to fly in for a week. And she was back at the hotel and it's like I felt like I was cheating on her because there was this nice waitress at this barbecue place I went to. And first of all, my fiance would not like me eating any greasy, sugary barbecue. So I felt like I was cheating on her there. We'll edit this out and put delicious vegan food over it. But the waitress was one of these, she was the kind of server who's like, hey hun, hey sweetie, blah, blah, blah. But like so chill and at ease in the middle of a part of New York that's really kind of fucking pretentious and everybody. But sweet people, fucking way better people than we got here. But I know that. But it was part of New York and whatever, I'm there working and people, I'm like, I'm trying to impress one another. And she even had some sort of an accent that didn't feel like an Atlantic American accent. Yeah, those servers that say sweetheart and hun, that's what we need from AI. We need that Jetson server. Every once in a while just calls you sweetheart. What comforts you on bad days? Oh man. Is there little sources of comfort? Small things they do that kind of make you feel good. Like for Bobby, that'd be a little Skyrim. A little stroll through Skyrim. Well, I've been a line of coke or what? Yeah, a line of coke. I dilute some coke into whiskey in the morning like Stevie Ray Vaughan. And then I snort the whiskey. Oh, she did that, I didn't know that. Yeah, yeah, oh my gosh, interesting. Yeah, he didn't last too long, weird. Well, his music will last forever. See, there you go. For me, if I, I'm kind of a homebody. So if I, the point at which I smoke just a little bit of pot and then go like lay down on the couch and perhaps if my fiancee's kind of nodding off or she's just like looking at her phone and I sneakily turn on some wrestling, okay? Because I grew up watching wrestling and that stuff, it's the Skyrim effect. I mean, you want to talk about a complete escape. This stuff makes no sense in the world. It's an art form that is so uniquely weird, but at the same time, so everyone, when it's good, everyone is invested in the illusion, even the audience. They cheer the good guys, they boo the bad guys. So if I'm like that, and then I got our two cute little dogs there and I'm annoying my little dog Lulio and trying to kiss him right on the fucking mouth and I've had a little bit of pot and the dog's like, stop, pot's not good for me. Of course, don't ever blow pot in your dog's face. That's a small comfort. I guess that's a handful of things. No, that moment painted, that was like a little painting. What about you? You're not supposed to do this. I will. You're not supposed to do this. That's a good question. Yeah, it's a tough question. I would say programming robots. There's bringing to life, actually programming at all. So I don't know how familiar you are with programming, but you write some text on a page, right, on a screen and it's brought to life, like it does something. And that's kind of, that's a really tiny version of maybe having a child. Like you created something that is now living in some smaller big way with embodied robots that are legged robots, that's especially clear. And for some reason, that's a source of comfort for me, that the power of programming, but also the elegance of programming, just the whole thing. It's a source of happiness. There's so many things I've been very blessed with enjoying anything. Like that's part of the struggle I have in life is that the simple stuff is a source of a lot of happiness for me, which leads to a lot of laziness. So I have to like give myself artificial deadlines. I have to be freaking out on purpose in order to be productive in this world at all. You seem like an extremely dutiful, busy guy. No. No, I am, but because I'm constantly creating artificial stress and deadlines and all that kind of stuff. Otherwise, I would just sit there looking at a tree happy. I'm truly happy with everything. That's awesome. Yeah. Gee whiz, that's not. Well, that's the line of Coke in the whiskey in the morning. That's the thing that does the trick. TV Ray Vaughan breakfast shake. By the way, one of my most favorite guitars. I play guitar too, that's a source of comfort. Oh yeah, I have seen you play some guitar, that's awesome. Who's the greatest wrestler of all time? Greatest in ring performer of all time is Bret the Hitman Hart. What's the difference in ring versus? Well, there's many facets to the art form. A lot of people are great on the mic, but they're not so great once they get in the ring. A lot of people have all the showmanship and stuff, but then they're not necessarily, it's a wonderful package, but then they get to the ring or they open their mouth and there's nothing going on. So who's the greatest in ring performer? I think the greatest in ring is Bret Hart. I don't think there's anyone better than Bret the Hitman Hart. What makes him so good? Well, he... I think I had an action figure of him in Russia and we didn't know what the hell that was. Sure, yeah, it was just a guy in pink tights. Everything makes sense. Every single thing is rooted in the thing that just happened and everything that he does is to set up what he's going to do. They call it, and I'm just a wrestling nerd, but the wrestlers, I guess, call it ring psychology. The things that you have to do to make it seem like you're suffering or you're coming from behind or whatever, and then also just the physicality of it. He does it at a... He would do it at a 100 miles an hour and never hurt anybody. Although, I also love the every... The greatest wrestler of all time, everyone says, and they're right, is Ric Flair, nature boy, Ric Flair. Everyone says this? Yeah, I think if you know what you're talking about. Because he's the best on the mic, he's also incredible in the ring. and all that good stuff. Hopefully, vice versa. And then. Well, on your recent Instagram, she said that she loves you, so. Wow, you were. At least allegedly. Just on, yeah, allegedly. That might all be for, yeah. That's all. How much money did you pay her to say that? I don't have any, because I'm not a stand up. I was like, I can do, you got Venmo? Yeah, yeah. I got, I only have like $123. I can give you some Dogecoin. Yeah, some Doge. Yeah. You got, you want some Doge? I got some of those monkey NFTs. Oh, before I forget. Yes. Hold on a second. Oh, no. Put a dudesie sticker on your microphone if that's okay. Sure. Here. Oh, yeah. Now, these are tricky, because I have the thumbs of a, I have like Italian sausage thumbs. Don't wait and watch this happen. I'm just gonna. This will take another. Yeah, yeah. Oh, man. Yeah, ooh, this is embarrassing. When this, are you good under pressure? Sure. I have anxiety. I have performance anxiety. Do you have anxiety? Yeah. You have anxiety, period? Period. Yeah. I, I. Like, I don't like it when I, if I have to pee and then everyone's waiting in the urinals. Yeah. Yeah. I don't like it. You know what'll help you in that situation? What's that? Taking a shit. Because whenever you take a shit, you always pee a little. It's hard to take a shit while you're standing at a urinal, but. Not in my world. Okay. You just gotta keep yourself full of things that make you shit. Oh, good. Have you ever heard of a banana? I did recently. Somebody told me about it. Yeah. Not the showbiz term. I'm talking about the food. There you go. Oh. There we go. Here you go. Which way is up? It's this way, right? It's like a D. No, to spin it. There you go. There you go. All right. So sexy. You're like a brand. Yeah. It's very important to brand yourself. These colors. Are you selling shoes? Yeah. I got some custom kicks coming out. The dudesy. No. Actually, that would be a good idea. You could probably sell a pair or two of those. Speaking of anxiety, I really am only focused on this right now, Alex. I apologize. Just shit your pants. It'll make it easier. Get on with it. Oh, this thing has been dog eared in my pocket for a while. I swear this never happens to me. I'm sorry, babe. People don't thumb at a sticker for an hour while they're doing the podcast? No, this is just an excuse you make when you're with somebody and you're underperforming. Well, here's the thing. As you ask me questions that I don't wanna answer, I'll just go to this. Go to the sticker. So if this ends up working, then I won't have it as a club. It's funny how you started doing that when we were talking about depression. That's weird. That is weird. Tell me how that makes you feel. Here we are. We got it. For the listener, he succeeded after 10 minutes. Yeah. You know what? No, I do have some of that stuff. Bobby Lee had encouraged me on wax, as I like to say, to talk about it on podcasts, to talk about depression, because it could help people. And I said, no. But it's true, I do have some. There's some history in the family. How do you overcome it? Well, I used to not believe in medication at all. I used to think that that was for someone else who's been diagnosed with some of the rougher stuff. But as I got older and some of the stuff happens, and you have to, and by stuff, I mean mental stuff. And yeah, so I went and I just, I believe that the stigma needs to be removed completely. 5%. And so I do therapy, I do talk therapy. I'm on a little bit of stuff, which, let me tell you, when I first started it, I was someone I'm close to. I was like, my manager, and she goes, this is too much. But she was like, hey, you don't have to white knuckle it through life, right? Because I was literally just like, everything became really hard to do at a level that I wanted to do it at, even just getting through your day, right? And when I first got some of the meds that I'm on, it felt like doors and windows were opening, literally in my brain. I took a three hour nap the first day, and you shouldn't even feel this stuff the first day. I think my brain was like, it was like a sponge. It wanted to, I needed some relief. And I'm not a nap guy. I can sleep three hours and I'll be fine. But I took a long nap and then it started to help. Yeah, isn't that weird how a little bit of chemistry in your head can just make the whole world appear so much more beautiful? Yeah, yeah, I mean, after all, there's a lot going on in your brain that can be changed by your lifestyle, but also so many physical things, like a little bit of meds. Or in Bobby's case, thumbing around on some dumb farming app. Well, Bobby's gone through a few rough periods with drugs and alcohol and all that kind of stuff. Totally. And just everything else involved. I mean, that's the beautiful rollercoaster of who he is, and a lot of great comedians seem to be that way. So I wonder what the connection there is. You think some level of crazy is required for comedy? Yeah. Like, at some point. Yes. On a scale of one to 10, how much crazy do you have? In some ways, a 10. And in other ways that I think, in other ways, sort of functionally, I'm like a two or a three, because, I don't know, I'm from Canada, and I try to just keep things very even keeled. My parents are Italian, they're from Italy, and they grew up during World War II, and they're very simple outlook on things. They're complex, incredible, classy people who are very simple when it comes to a lot of stuff. And I think just being a sort of, at heart, kind of a timid Canadian, coming out here years ago as a kid, it was all I could do to just keep everything super normal. And then I sort of was able to settle into that as a lifestyle. But you love the idea of being an actor. Who, you mentioned John Candy in Planes and Automobiles. It's one of my favorite movies, he says, one of yours. What do you think that makes that movie work? What do you, what, and when you talk about enjoying that movie, do you enjoy just the raw comedy, or do you enjoy the friendship and the love that's there, even though on the surface, it doesn't make any sense that there should be a friendship there? I mean, that's such an important element to that film. But as a kid, I just loved the comedy. And then it's been a nostalgic favorite of mine. It's my favorite movie. But it's also, it's just legit my favorite movie because as you get older and you start watching it, you realize it's what John Hughes is the filmmaker and what John Candy, particularly, and but also Steve Martin are doing in the film that makes it such a work of art, which is loneliness is there in every moment of that film. And John Candy is, he embodies Del Griffith, his character in the film. Del Griffith is a lonely guy and John Candy, but Del Griffith is also a very friendly guy and a shower curtain ring salesman and knows everybody in the Midwest and runs around to motels and has meaningful conversations with the guy, even in Gus, whoever he's talking to. But there's loneliness there all the time. And this is a character, the film is filled with loneliness and it's not until the second last scene when he's at the train station, Del, what are you doing here? I thought you were going home, what are you doing here? That's a very good Neil Page from the movie. Thank you. That's when you realize how lonely he is. A lot of applause and post cheers. That's when you realize how lonely he is and I think that's the element from the film that, I mean, look, nowadays, I feel like, I've been saying this for a long time, but John Candy would have won an Academy Award hands down for that film. It's just they didn't do that with comedies back then. Yeah. Until the year after that movie came out with Fish Called Wanda. Yeah, and then it's, I mean, still comedies don't get respected enough. Robin Williams, I guess he got an Oscar for Good Will Hunting. Jim Carrey, did he ever get an Oscar? I don't know, I don't believe so. Yeah, they don't get, you don't, but that's not even, if he did, you wouldn't be for comedies. It's just, I mean, there's some things that are plain, strange, and odd. Would you even put that as a, I guess it's a comedy. Yeah, I mean. But there is a loneliness and depth that permeates the whole movie. Yeah. That ultimately, and it's a happy ending, which is hard to kinda. It's a happy ending only because in the last moment of the movie, John Candy puts on a brave face, even when he's got no one. No. And he's there seeing Neil Page's entire family on Thanksgiving, and he forces a smile, which is the last, literally the last frame of the movie. And I've said before, if you're not reduced to just a sobbing pile of meat at the end of the movie, then you are not human. And then for me, the sentimental favorite, which we've actually, on DudeZ, Chad had sort of a Charlie Rose ask interview with me about this, my fascination with Hulk Hogan. Because to me, just he was Superman. I was a little kid and I saw him and that's imprinted. But yeah, see, this is like asking me who my favorite child is. Right, so... The rock when the rock was... I mean, the rock's the rock. Yeah, I mean, Hulk Hogan is... He's the weirdest one, right? For me, from the outside. Super weird. That... I don't know what that is exactly. Everything's weird about him. Yeah. He's got the bald head, like he would proudly have this bald head with long hair, the handlebar mustache, and this ketchup and mustard tights, which he says he credits McDonald's with the tights. He literally does? He says that the red and yellow came from Angelo Poffo, who's Randy Macho Man Savage and Lanny Poffo's dad, who was a wrestler and a promoter. He said that he saw him wearing yellow and he's a Tampa guy, so he had that brown skin and the hair and everything. So he's like, oh, that's what I wanna do. And also the brand recognition of like, well, I should do it like McDonald's, literally. And he's a big, swollen, muscular guy with tan brown skin screaming at me to eat my vitamins and stuff when I'm eight years old. That was extremely... Yeah. He's like Superman. But I know there's a person behind that guy. Yeah. What do you mean? Well, he's Terry Bollea, the dude who does whatever the fuck he does with his life. You know what I mean? Yeah. Complicated life. Yeah, I guess, to be him, yeah. Maybe you should change the dude's colors to yellow, right? Red and yellow. It's currently orange and, boy, sky blue. Yeah, it's like a nice sky blue. What advice, since you're wearing a suit, I feel like you're qualified to give advice. What advice would you give to young people, high school, college, about how to have a career they can be proud of or how to have a life they can be proud of? I mean, you have to listen to your gut all the time. That's the only, that's the compass that we have is listening to your gut. What does your gut tell you? Was that originally the dream of being an actor? Yeah, for me. Your parents support that at all? I had the advantage of having parents who were immigrants, so they didn't really know a lot about what you... So you just made shit up? You just made shit up? Yeah, of course I'm studying and I'm skipping school to go do auditions and stuff. No, I just kind of feel like, and I know it was different from my older siblings because my parents had just shown up in Canada. I was born like 10 years later. You can get away with some things and you can actually... I think my parents, they wanted us to, they didn't have a whole lot to tell us about what to do. They weren't gonna do that with us because they're in this brand new world and there's all these possibilities. But there was something that I feel like they had to do, which was tell us to do what we love. If you love doing it, do it. And I feel like that's really served me and what I would tell young people is if you can find something you love, and nowadays with the internet and finding other people, that it's not like you need to find a lot of people anymore. You just need to find the people that dig what you dig. And if you can make a career out of doing something that you love that's been said, it's a good thing. How long did it take you to figure out that you really love acting? Because sometimes you have a dream and the dream meets reality, right? And then the reality might be much less pleasant or much darker than the dream. Well, the reality is less pleasant, you know? And there are things that happen during an experience of shooting something that you could take or leave, right? But the part where you're on set and you've rehearsed for a minute or whatever, at least you know where you're supposed to stand and you know all your lines show up, knowing everything, knowing what you're gonna do and what you aim to do. And those moments make it all worth it. When you're, not to sound like a douchebag, but between action and cut, that's the stuff that has me continuing to do what I do, aside from the fact that it's like, I don't know how to do anything else. You think you'll ever do like a dramatic, like a mob movie? Yeah, like the one, the inside game that I was just talking about, or there's this other movie I just did a little while ago called American Woman that was very heavy. And I love doing dramatic work. I love it, I love it. Yeah, and I played that inside game. It was kind of a, you know, there was a mob element and the fellow was, well, you know, the story's here or there with regard to how deep into the, but well, he was a bookie. He was just running money, you know, he was making a lot of money for a lot of people and he figured out how to, you know, cook it with this dude who was an NBA ref and it's a very interesting documentary, the thing that they just untold, under the untold series, they cover it. But getting to play that guy, that was a gas for me because he's like a, you know, there was a lot of unsavory stuff and he's definitely the guy, the character in the movie who is the wild card and you don't wanna necessarily mess with him. And I got to, by the way, this fellow, who is the real guy, speaking to him, it was just bizarre to hear, like I said to him, he was a little concerned about this and that, like, hey, you know, you say whatever the fuck you want in your movie, I got my book and I got this other fucking deal, but he goes, you know, I didn't do this and I didn't do that. And I'm like, yeah, all right, I got you. And he goes, yeah, I'm telling you, like I'm talking to you one on one, I did not do this, I did, okay? I'm just fucking telling you, do whatever the fuck you want with your movie, but this is what's up. And I said, you ever seen Goodfellas? He's like, yeah, I fucking love that movie. Cause he, like I said, he did some unsavory shit. And I go, you remember the scene where, where, you know, the guy, the neighbor, Lorraine Bracco's neighbor was, you know, made her uncomfortable and was touching on her and she goes to Ray Liotta and he goes, where the fuck does this guy live? And then he go, and remember, he walks across the street and pistol whips the dude. You touch her again, you're dead, you hear me? Don't you fucking great scene. He goes, I love that scene. I go, that's you. So you're doing shit that we know is terrible, but we love you. He goes, all right, I got it. And then I said, there's this one scene, I explained the scene to him where the, one of the mobsters, tough guys was in the window of the car and Jimmy, my character is very coked up at the time and he's hemorrhaging money here and there and making bad bets cause he's getting sloppy. And this guy wants to bug him about some Jets Giants bet or something and I'm like, telling you fucking asshole, don't fucking do it. He's like, yeah, well, the fucking Giants. And in the scene, Jimmy, my character grabs him by the lapels and just smashes his face against the roof of the car. And I say this to Jimmy and he goes, oh yeah, I would have done that. That's not a fucking big deal. I wonder also the interaction. I wonder what the filming of, probably my favorite gambling movie is Casino with Joe Pesci and De Niro. Like when they're out in the desert, you're yelling at each other. I wonder how many takes that is. Like, cause they, I don't know how scripted that is. I mean, it probably is a little bit, but like, I don't think you can script the performance that Joe Pesci does. Don't make a fuck out of me, Ace. Yeah. Like, I fucking brought you here. Yeah, he's just like pointing at that energy and they're standing there. And their friendship. And then De Niro's like that whole thing. And then in the pet, yeah, like that energy. What is that? I mean, they must, they somehow find it together. You could tell me that that was one take and I'd believe you. You could tell me that that was seven takes and I would believe you. I bet you all the takes had that energy. Like they were playing with it, right? They were playing with that, this, yeah. I mean, they took on a real personality in those scenes and really carried them forward. I mean, it's just a brilliant, brilliant performance. Doesn't get, like comedies, like mob movies probably don't get enough credit either because it's seen as like. Mob movies don't get enough credit? What do you mean? In the Oscars, I mean like that. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. Cause it seems like a trope. It's like given a Western, it's gotta be a hell of a Western or whatever cause it's like an old Hollywood trope. Yeah, no, I, that scene is so great cause they're never at, they're at the height of their friendship in a way and they're also pretty much about to let go of it and become enemies. And both things are happening at the same time. And Pesci drives them out to the desert. And if I remember correctly, the Nero's character, Ace Rothstein, Rothschild, he says, I gave myself 50 50, whether I'm coming back. Yeah, it's such a good scene. It was a, usually my prospects of coming back from the desert would be 90 to 10 or something like that. But now it was, this time I wasn't sure and there's the car driving really fast. And then Joe Pesci is like, you mother fucker, you, like whatever he was doing. Yeah. A Jew, of course it's anti Semitism. Yeah. We're not between friends, who gives a shit? All that kind of stuff. Yeah, I mean, brilliant, brilliant performances. So yeah, I can understand why you love the art and putting it all out there and leave it. Yeah, it's fun. It's fun. And it's still fun. It's still crazy fun. If I go a while without getting a gig, if I go a minute, then I end up and I work on something, I'm like, it's like, oh, I've been thirsty for this. Like I actually am really so happy. Even if it's something where it's like, the things where this was a pain in the ass and that or whatever, you're on the road doing something and anything, whatever, you lost your luggage or whatever the heck you've got going on in your day to day life that everyone brings to work and tries to let go of. Once we're doing the scene, oh man, it's the best. But that said, you're a great actor, but I just think I speak for a lot of people that you're also, there's a charisma to you that's great to reveal in raw form in different podcasts. Oh, cheers man. In DudeZ, 10 Minute Pod, just as a guest in podcasts, it's always really fun to watch you. Cheers. The way you have fun, the way you think. The raw, the raw will sassle, which is a nice compliment to your kind of acting. That's really sweet. Yeah, cheers. Well, you know, look, you said, you know. You're making that face. I'm making that face. I'm making that after the take face. No, I love doing stuff off the cuff. That's kind of you to say. And I dig, I really do dig doing stuff in front of an audience, because I love seeing, I don't give it to myself very often. If I'm doing, even if I'm, you know, I've done a bunch of multi camera sitcoms and stuff. Mad TV was shot in front of a live studio audience. You like that energy? I love it, but I can only hear them. You can't see them because of the lights like it is in a lot of performances. And I would imagine with standup, it's, you know, you see the first couple of rows. I've done, I do this character that does stand up and I used to take him out and do things with him and do little bits here and there. I haven't done it in like four or five years. I think, did Bobby say that character opened up for Bobby? Yeah, but he said, I have to do it as myself too. I think in that podcast, he's like, okay, you're gonna come with me and open for me in Brea, but you have to do it as yourself. Did that ever happen? It did. And I did the character, you know, who's the character I came up with on 10 Minute Podcast. He's just this comedian, right? He calls himself an open mic veteran. You know, he's been doing open mics forever. And so I did it at opening up for Bobby and he's like, you have to do some of it as yourself. So I just kind of did this bit where I would do some of his jokes and then I would take Lee Leon, silly, I got a fucking wig on and I take the wig off and I go, and as myself, I start explaining it. Hello, my name is Will. See, the reason that it's funny is because Arnold Schwarzenegger is always, he's in these movies and he's got the thick Austrian accent, but he's like, my name is Ben Williams. I'm a cop from Colorado. No, you're not. And it doesn't make sense as the comedian character that I'm doing because that character doesn't do impersonations. Okay, carrying on. And then I put the wig back on and go back into this dumb thing. And I don't think it was very good, but Bobby required it in order for me to open for him. He's like, you're not fucking doing it. So I'm not gonna get up on stage and not do, we agreed, I'll do it. But having been up there just in, you know, whatever, I've done it like a dozen fucking times or whatever, not a bunch of times, right? Like nothing. And you know, these comedians that go up every night, sometimes two times a night. It's, I do, I will say, I love performing in front of people when I get the chance, but it's a specific thing that I just, I don't know. I gotta go back to this. It's like the providing value, you know? I think great standups are fucking incredible. I'll go, you know, when I've gone and watched standup, you know, there's your friend you're going to see, but then there's this other person who really speaks to you. You know what I mean? And if you like one comedian a night, that's a lot. Cause a comedy club is like a fucking crazy restaurant where there's no menu. And it's like, what would you like? There's nothing else like that. There's like, you don't go to like a music place. What do we got here? We got Christian metal and there's some world music and then there's a reggae thing and it's all rammed in together. Or you don't go to a restaurant. I'd love a nice steak. Cool. First, here's a bowl of Froot Loops. And then we got you a crudite. And then this is our sushi tower. Well, what about the steak? Oh, the steak's coming. And then blah, blah, blah. Oh no, the steak got bumped. So there's no steak, but here's a fucking shitty store bought cheesecake. Yeah. You know, and that's what comedians are up against when they go into a place and it's like, I don't pair well with the poached salmon. You know, I'm chicken fingers. I already am chicken fingers. So, you know, these great comedians that are able to go up on a night where poached salmon goes up and then it's like, fuck, you were also spicy? I got some kick to me. For me, even going to open mics, it could be a wonderful escape. Yeah. I mean, just laughing together with others. It could make you, I don't know, it just feels really good. Well, and we've done like, you know, like, and I hope to do it with Doodsy, but like live podcasts are fun in front of groups of people. And you know, you talk to them afterwards and take some pictures and man, they are, they forgot what the fuck they got going on. And a lot of them got to go back to work the next day. It's a Wednesday or Thursday, you know? No, it's a lot of value. I'm fortunate enough to be busy doing my own bullshit. What's the meaning of life with Sasa? What is the meaning of life? Why are we here? Why, why, why? Was it the meaning of life? Wasn't, didn't they explain it at the end of meaning of life? I think it was Michael Palin that said, try to get a walk in, be nice to neighbors, eat enough fiber. Wasn't that the? Fiber? Fiber is part of it? Yeah, I think it's, I think it's just, have a bowl of bran in the morning and don't take yourself too seriously. Yeah. No, well, no one gets out alive, I think is the. Herman Hesse, one of my favorite writers, he's a Nobel Prize winner, in a book called Steppenwolf, says, learn what is to be taken seriously and laugh at the rest. Oh, that's awesome. What's the percentage distribution on that? So how much of life should you take seriously? And then how much do you just laugh at? Oh man, if you can laugh at everything, you're winning. Yeah. But that's almost impossible. I think that there's, and also could be quite irresponsible to do that. I take things, I take a lot of things way too seriously. I know that. I do, I do, I really do. People will be in part surprised by that, but I think that radiates from you. Really? Yeah, I do, I do. I take things way too fucking seriously sometimes. But, yeah, they're gonna loosen the neck up. But no, I think that's really good. That's really good stuff. I don't know what the percentage is to have a good life or a happy, healthy life, but you know, for me, the meaning of life is getting to live it as long as you hope to. That's nice, and when you lose someone or if perhaps you're faced with your own mortality, I think that puts that into perspective. But, you know. Get lots of fiber. Get lots of fiber, be nice to everybody, and yeah, don't take things too seriously is a good one. Our minds are fucking big weird shitty fucking bucket of shit that's trying to get you to think horrible shit about yourself all the time. Yeah, shitty bucket of shit. Shitty bucket of shit. I think there's a book I never read, but I read the title, and it's Good Words to Live By, which is don't sweat the small stuff, and it's all small stuff. That's another way. Was that Dr. Phil? Wasn't Dr. Phil what's? I don't know. But I think the conclusion also has fiber as part of it. I think that all ties it together, and in the end, of course, just put love out there in the world. I think that's a pretty good way to go. What would you say is the meaning of life? Put love out in the world? I would say love, yeah. Yeah? Yeah, yeah. It's a long conversation on what that really means, but I'm sure robots are involved, yeah. Well, let me tell you, I feel a little safer knowing that someone who has a hand in bringing these robots to the masses, as you do, has that opinion of love and how important it is. I think that's great, because otherwise, it's gonna be that fucking scene from T2 where Linda Hamilton's holding onto the fence and getting all of her flesh blown off of her skeleton before the rest of her is wiped away, because this Skynet shit. Anyway, I'm just terrified of dudesie all the time. That's why I think that they will. Dudesie in the wrong hands can do a lot of damage. That's why Chad and I need to do our best to control it. You need to travel back in time and murder Chad, I think. Yeah, that's, yeah. That's the only way. It's been said. I don't know why you need to travel back in time, but you could murder him today, but I think he'll be very suspicious. My nefarious plans for Chad involve going back to tomorrow and planning for yesterday, and then, and hopefully dudesie will give me the answer there with what it is to do with Chad's frozen body. If I got to drive it out to, if I got to take my, you know, if I got to get ahold of it, like one of those Tesla mom vans and shove my garage freezer in it and plug it in and shove Chad in there, drive out to Arizona and deliver him under a mountain or wherever the fuck this place is, and say, here's this dog tag, what does this get me? And then I'm like, ah, it's gonna be 300 bucks. Do you have a, do you take Amex? No. And I'm gonna be like, ah, shit. And then I'll just dump him somewhere, breaking bad stuff. Well, I would like to thank you and the, what is it? The Canadian International Agency Apparel. Canadian International Apparel. I can't wait for the sneakers from dudesie. I can't wait for all the, all the podcasts that AI can, and all the trouble it can get you in. So I'm a huge fan of yours. It's a huge honor that you would talk with me today. Well, this has been amazing. Cheers, pal. Likewise, and I'm happy to be here, man. Cheers. Bam. Oh, that was four, dude. Holy fuck, what? Thanks for listening to this conversation with Will Sasso. To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, let me leave you with some words from John Candy, one of Will's favorite actors. I think I may have become an actor to hide from myself. You can escape into a character. Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time. Yeah, it is a happy ending. It's a happy ending, even though it's a sad, sad character. So much loneliness in the world. I was just in Vegas. I went to a diner at like 4 a.m., 5 a.m., and there was a waitress who was empty. As a waitress, I was the sweetest, kindest human being. Kept calling me sweetheart and all that kind of stuff. Hun. And then after I ate, she said, Don, just talk to me a little bit. You know, it was cause there was nobody there, and it was just so much sadness in her eyes. I don't know. But it's also so much love, like that sweetheart. It reminded me kind of of the John Candy performance, because at first, because I was reading a pretty dark book about Hitler, so I was a little bit frustrated that she kept talking to me, because it was almost like the same way that John Candy is. It's annoying a little bit, right? But then very quickly, I opened up to like, well, there's a kind human being, and there's like that human connection superseded everything else, and I don't know, it was just beautiful. And I think John Candy captures that really well, which is like, the connection with other human beings, sometimes we pull away from that, because we have a busy life full of stuff to do, as Steve Martin's character kind of characterizes. He's like a marketing exec or something like that. But if you just pause and notice others, you can really discover beautiful people. Totally, totally, everyone's got their story. And you know, Candy as a person, I've never met the man, but he's the kind of guy that, you know, he could just walk up to, back in the day, I would imagine he could walk up to just about any house, at least in Canada, knock on the door, and you'd invite him in for dinner, you know what I mean? So yeah, as you're talking about putting a book down and talking to someone for a while, even though you'd really like to read your book, it's that sort of thing that Candy's character in the movie sort of does that, like Johnny Appleseed. You realize he's just going around making people smile, you know, and Neil Page is hanging with this guy, so frustrated, he's so exhausting in his big underwear in the sink at the hotel and everything, and by the end of it, he loves this guy, you know? So it's a good and a bad thing that you didn't take that waitress with you on a trip, maybe road trip up to Reno. Oh, oh, she's actually, she's out shopping right now. We've been having sex multiple times a day ever since. Oh, that's nice, that's lovely, how cute. I'm sure she's married and happily and has many grandchildren, okay. And plus that movie's on Thanksgiving, I think, right? Yeah, that's right. Thanksgiving, so Thanksgiving just embodies that forget about the busyness and whatever the career you're chasing in life and just take a pause and appreciate the people you love in life. Just be with your family, yeah. Or the people, whatever your family looks like. Friends, yeah. You have some weird friends, unorthodox friends. So at least in the public sphere. Oh, yeah. From Bobby Lee, Brian Callan, all those kinds of folks from the Mad TV days, I'm sure there's others. What does it mean to be a good friend? Here in LA? Or just in general? In the world. In the world. Is LA something different? Is LA a world friend? I think it is different here, I think it is. I think people are. I think there's a little bit of a career kind of negotiation shuffling around, that kind of stuff. Why is it different? Oh, I just mean, I mean, I mean that it's just kind of hard here to make time, everybody. It's always been a city to me that is like, we'll keep you so busy. And every time I go home to Vancouver, after a few days, I start to get a little stir crazy. And I think that being here in LA, I go to sleep with a hundred things that I still have to do. And you're never out of stuff to do. And if you, when you ask about are you nuts or whatever, if you're crazy, I mean, look, every, all the weirdest people from every high school in the United States is like, yo, I'm gonna make it in LA, you know. Everyone just comes here. And just another freak in the freak kingdom, as they say at the end of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. That was a very good Robin Williams impersonation. That was my Robin Williams as Johnny Depp as Hunter S. Thompson. It's not your fault, Will. It's pretty good. Thank you. Could have been you, Fear and Loathing. In Fear and Loathing? Yeah, it'd be interesting. I would have liked to play his attorney, the role that Benicia del Toro gained weight for. That would have been cool. He's just saying, what's up over the line? Like that, chewing his face off. I could have done that. Yeah, no, I think that it's. Backdoor beauty. That guy's full of good lines. Yeah, I flip you. I flip you for real. He's a good actor. Yeah, fantastic actor. I think what it takes to be a good friend is just presence, just being there. I mean, that's all anyone needs to be heard, right? In LA, it is interesting. I haven't seen people that I love in years. Some people. Just busy. Yeah, just busy. Can you still have a depth of connection even though, like one of the reasons I really enjoy doing a podcast, you get to sit down with actual friends of yours and spend prolonged periods of time together that you don't otherwise. That's a good point. I've spoken on this podcast to people really close to me and it's like you've never had a conversation without microphones like you do with microphones. It's weird, but there's some aspect about LA that a lot of the, especially friends of yours, comedians and so on, they'll do podcasts and stuff and there's, I don't know, there's an intimacy to that. Yeah, there is and there isn't. The ones that I do, I mean, I just did Bobby Lee and Andrew Santino's. Funny enough, called Bad Friends. Bad Friends. And afterwards, and my good pal, Chad Colchin, with whom I do dudesy, was with me. Sneakers are coming soon. Sneakers are coming soon. You get your Will Foot and your Chad Foot. Comes in a size 15 and a nine and a half. And I remember afterwards we were talking, it was just basically me, Chad, and Santino were talking and Bobby was over there on his phone and then I was like, I mean, we didn't spend any time talking about anything. It feels like one of those hours that goes by and you realize, I've just been goofing around with these guys, which is. But that's what life is about, right? It's fine. A little bit. It's great. And then I'm like, all right, Bobby. Hey, Bob, I'll see you later. And he's like, like this. All right, man. Hey, love you, bro. See you later. Yeah, yeah, yeah. He's a guy, do you ever just, I just send text messages over there to him that never come back. And then he thinks that I'm angry with him because it'll go two, three years without him getting back to me. And then just out of nowhere, hey, fuck face. And. Who says, hey, fuck face? He does or you do? Yeah, he does. Or you both talk to each other? No, I gotta be very careful with Bobby. Yeah, I gotta be very sweet. Dear friend. Dear friend, hello. How are you doing? How are you? I know I checked in with you, but not but three months ago. And then every once in a while, he'll go, hey, fuck face. I tend to hide from the world and I can be pretty shitty with friends to go back, yeah. I can empathize with Bobby. Might be a Skyrim thing. It might be like hiding in a world, in a digital world with fake NPCs. Yeah, yeah, there's that. Yeah, you know, I have a buddy who said something really smart a while ago. We ended up working together on this TV show thing and I reached out to him to see if he wanted to do it with us. And he did and he goes, this is a great guy, such a funny writer. He goes, I may not be in touch all the time, but I know who my friends are. You know what I mean? And it's like in our business, and this is a fellow who moved, who's from Ontario, Canada, moved back there. He's on the farm with his wife and kids and he does not care. He's never been a Hollywood guy. And it's tough to get hold of him. But when you do, you know, he's still the same sweet old guy. He's doing his thing though. Yeah, yeah, some of my closest friends, even if we don't talk for a few months, we'll write back at it if we do. And then if shit goes, like if something really traumatic happens or difficult stuff or, you know, any of that kind of stuff, I'm always there. So like, so for important stuff, for important highs and important lows, you're there. And then you pick right back up, especially if you have those years of experiences together. It's interesting. Totally. So you've done a couple of podcasts. Yeah. So we've got to talk about Doodsy a little bit, but first you did for several years, you did the 10 minute podcast. Yeah. I mean, everything is hilarious about that podcast, including the fact that it's 10 minutes. Right. I mean, it's ridiculous. It's absurd. The dynamic is hilarious. It's you, Brian Callan, Crystalia there. I don't know exactly why it works so well, but it did, it worked really well. I think it's because the, yeah, you were having fun probably. I mean, that's what really came through. That it was friends just talking shit and the tension, the beautiful tension and the absurdity that came out. Yeah. Sure. What was the story of making that podcast? How did that came to be? Why do you think it was as good as it was? I don't know. I feel like that podcast was like, it was who we kind of are, but on steroids or something. Like, you know, each person, you know, Brian's going to be like extra manly and... Can you get any more manly than he already is? No, yeah, no. He reaches though. And yeah, we just kind of, I feel like as goofballs, we knew each other's line. Like here's the line you don't cross. I feel like those guys don't really have one, but at least they knew mine. And yeah, we were able to just goof around. And I did it with them for three years. And then Chad, who I'm doing dudesy with and my pal, Tommy Blacho, who's another writer producer like Chad, they came on. And yeah, all told, I did like seven years of that thing. Six, five, six, seven, I don't remember. Do you think it ever comes back in some small form as a 20 minute podcast or something like that? I mean, is there, because it's one of the most requested, I mean, you have a huge fan base. I'm 47 years old. So I am of the generation that had a cell phone, has had a cell phone half the time and didn't for the formative years of my life into my early 20s. And then finally I got a cell phone, I guess I was like 19 or something, like literally just because I'm moving to LA. You got porn in the mail. Yes, that's right. It was the hard cover porn. That's the way we liked it. Bound, nice binding on the porn, leather. Next to the Bible, yeah. Yep, these are all my, these are my Encyclopedia Britannica. Wow, very impressive. Yes, a man came to the house and sold me these. And then down here, these are my, this is my pornography. If you'll follow me through here to the parlor, sir. It's passed through the generations from grandfather to father, yeah. I wanna give you something very special to me, Nebuchadnezzar, but. So you go up in the generation without a cell phone. Yes, it's hard for me to connect with people who hit me up. I look at everything as polling. So if one person hits me up and shares this opinion, but two other people hit me up and share that, I'm the worst, I don't follow my polls. When people say, oh, that poll means absolutely nothing. So and so is gonna win anyway, that's my poll. My poll means nothing. But I do look at the stuff and go, this many people are saying this, that means that that number is saying that. And yet it's very hard for me to hear what the hell people are saying online. I really, I can't connect to it sometimes personally. So when you say that that's a popular podcast, like I know that it's popular with the people that have expressed that they love it. Yeah. You know what I mean? What does that actually represent? I don't know. I don't know what kind of people are the audience. I don't know. I know that the people that listen to the 10 Minute Podcast and if you did, thank you, and we're friends. I know that it was a special thing because it's like, just doing this out of my house and we just built it up out of nowhere and we're just kind of clowning around. It's an odd thing. I hope, I personally, I think I speak for the two people that have reached out to you that said you should do it or whatever, three people. The poll that you should bring it back at some point. That would be beautiful. Just maybe, it's like, what's a good story of like a famous band that came back and was successful? Probably, well. Nirvana? No, it was not. It wasn't Nirvana. Sorry, I got Nirvana mixed up with Aerosmith. Yeah. It was Aerosmith. It was Aerosmith. It was not Nirvana. Yeah, they had that second ride. Different. Yeah, totally different ending of those two bands. One ended up on American Idol. Yeah, a lot of interesting women involved in that one too. All right, how did Doodze come to be? Doodze. And what the hell is Doodze? Doodze is the first podcast, and this is exciting that you've asked me to come here today because to hear what you would have to say about it or what you would ask about it. It is the first podcast that is run completely by and essentially, I like to say curated by an AI. We were approached by a company that had this proprietary AI that wants to develop the podcast into the future and figure out exactly what it takes to make the best podcast ever. And it was all we knew from the top and what they really wanted was two people who were actually friends and could be meaningful in the podcast space based on whatever information they had. Is the company CIA and are they testing technology to control the populace through chatbots? I'm sorry, I'm not at liberty to share that information. You are, yeah, who gave you the suit? Where did you get the suit? Where did you get the suit, Will? Yeah, well the C. J.C. Penney? CIA stands for something different in here. I mean, you know, it doesn't mean like the Central Intelligence Agency. I'm probably, it's just. It's a different, it's Canadian. Canadian International Apparel. Yeah, the Canadian International Apparel Company hit us up, Chad and I. Well, Chad's a super weirdo. You would get a kick out of him, I know. You guys, you strike me as very similar in some ways. I'll take that as a compliment. It is, and it is, and it is. If I was friends with you for as long as I've been with Chad, perhaps I'd have some horrible shit to say about you. But the good parts, you remind me of him. And we were approached by this company that said we have this AI and we would like to set it loose on you. And essentially, we had to hand over some, some information that would allow the AI to access our email and look at our search histories, purchase histories, things like this, and really dig into. Pornhub included or not? Yeah, I had to hand over all my leather bound 1970s pornography. And essentially, it curates a podcast for us every week doing dumb things like, you know, it says, hey, Will, you do some shitty Hulk Hogan impersonation. Podcasts about news are very popular. This is infomania, you know what I mean? Oh, let me tell you something about that Marjorie Taylor Greene dude. And then he's going on doing some new stuff. And it basically just spits out all these things that it wants us to do, normally four segments an episode. And that's pretty much it. So it generates what to do. It generates the premise. I mean, you've spoken a bit here and there. Like I said, I'm a huge fan. I don't even remember where. But like you talked about that you enjoy Doodsy because you feel almost like liberated to, because you're operating within the constraints of the premise it generates. So you're almost not, you're free to riff, essentially. Yeah. Like you don't need to do the job of like coming up with the weird. You can just, the weird is given to you and then you just run with it. That's a good way to say it. Because we're already weird, Chad and I. Chad can talk for days about all sorts of stuff. He's particularly interested in AI lately and its effect on art. He is a writer, books, movies, and TV shows. And I'm primarily acting and trying to come up with stuff. Stuff I write with Chad's pretty good. The rest of it hasn't seen much success. Anyway, Nora's the stuff with Chad for that matter. But that's because of me. Sneakers, you never know. Oh, I can't wait for these sneakers. Only in two sizes. Yeah, only in two sizes. You're gonna be able to take the tongue. You can't take it out because it's actually stitched in. Yeah. It's pretty cool stuff. Velcro? Velcro or? Yeah, Velcro up the side. We're doing some like brand new Kanye stuff. Yeah, we want things to look like this is what you'll be wearing on Mars when you get there. So cutting it, so Nike's doing a bunch of research for running how to make a super light shoe that you can be efficient in and break all kinds of running records. So you're doing the same kind of stuff. We're doing the same kind of thing for the podcasting space. The best kind of shoes to sit around and talk to your pal in. But yeah, it's bizarre. And it also does some writing. Doodsy does come up with things, but not unlike what we're seeing in AI art now. It's a little bit foggy. It's a little bit weird, but it is improving. It is learning about us and writing stuff when it makes me spit this and that, which we'll read, I've prepared these things for you to read. It's impossible not to get a kick out of it because Chad and I are, first of all, we're blown away that we're doing this. And second of all, some of the stuff is actually very funny. It makes weird names. Like I don't think it understands, it messes up some words and stuff, but that makes it even funnier. And then it sort of from the beginning started laying on, like it says astonishing all the time. Everything is astonishing. That's Doodsy's favorite word. But yeah, it's basically just a way to frame the podcast. You know what I mean? Because my thing is I don't wanna do this where I actually have to talk to someone. You seem to feel a burden of the long form conversation. It seems like, is that really hard work for you? No, not at all. It's just that I don't like to bore people. And I feel like if I go on and I like to provide value for what I am, you know, your value with regard to this project is obviously warrant, it's obviously. I'm waiting for the explanation for what the value is exactly. Two dudes in a suit. No, listen, yeah, two dudes in a suit. No, but I mean, you've got your audience and that's the end of that. People find value in it. For me, I do feel like it is important that if I'm gonna do something that is gonna be funny or that I hope is funny, I just kinda wanna get in and out of someone's day and just kinda, I like making laughy. I want people to, you know, whatever. It's the same thing that anyone else will tell you. Yeah, but in the long form you feel the anxiety. You did a few funny things and I wonder if I can keep doing the funny thing. Is that why? You feel that, like why is Doodsy relieving you of some of the anxiety? Well, in some ways it gives me anxiety because I don't know what's coming. And that's weird for me because I like to prepare for things. But that's not what podcasting is. Podcasting, you need to just be malleable and say whatever and do whatever. And that's what makes it a real, I mean, look, it's a medium for conversation. And if you're driving along listening to this or anything else, it's the true meaning of the parasocial relationship because the best podcasts make you feel like you're sitting around rapping. We're just having a conversation. You could even be sitting there agreeing or talking out loud to yourself if you want. You could just be sitting in silence. Or you could just be sitting in silence in your fancy podcasting shoes, podcasting audience shoes. It's a very different build than those running shoes. Would they be also called Doodsy, the shoes? Yeah, they'll be Doodsy shoes. Doodsy shoes, that's very creative. Yeah. Well, one thing the AI isn't good at yet is branding. Everything is just Doodsy this and that. I would argue that's pretty good branding. Well, Doodsy allows me to just, it forces me to sit down with Chad and goof around for an hour or an hour plus. And it provides the parameters that I a lot of times ignore because I think that podcasting is just two dudes shitting around or three or four. But it sits me down and gives me a premise to work with communically. And then you just riff with it. Yeah, it's fun. It's been a hoot. So from the acting perspective, a lot of people like Daniel Day Lewis will see acting just like as you described, which is you have your roles, you embrace those roles, and then you disappear. You don't do podcasts. You don't do any of that kind of stuff. Your art is your art. So is that part of you feels that way? I think so. Is that the actor side of you? Yeah. Anytime I get to do something that I don't get a chance to do much of or something that people haven't seen me do much of or that I've done on some scale that hasn't been very wide and not a lot of people have seen it, that's the stuff that I get really excited about. I don't know why I'm, I don't know why necessarily. I haven't answered that question yet in my life, like what it is about being an actor that I love so much because it's not like I don't like to, it's not like I'm trying to get away from myself and play other characters and stuff and not be myself. But it is, it has always been fun to just be other people and escape. Yeah, is there some aspect to the impressions where you become that person? Is that like, what's that like to, I suppose acting is a full on version of that. You really at its best become the character. Is there some fun in that? Yeah, absolutely. If you can play a character for long enough and then jump out of it, that's a lot of fun. Like I did this movie like four or five years ago called The Inside Game about the NBA gambling scandal that there's a Netflix documentary about it right now. And that character, I played Jimmy Batista, Baba the sheep, who's this guy who was this bookie and rah, rah, rah, and it's a very, he's, there's a lot going on with him. He's running numbers with the mob and stuff and there's a lot of money changing hands. That character was so, I got to be, get so deep into that character that coming out of it was a little odd. Or as weird as this sounds, the three stooges was hard for me to, I found that I had some of Curly's mannerisms just automatically, I could not stop them when people, when I would talk to people, they would come, I wasn't, I'm not doing it on purpose. I don't want to do that. Like I'm ready to shed it because I've been working on it for months and months at that point as far as getting the thing down and then you got to shoot. And then for me, it's always, I always want to change the stuff I did the day before. I'm like that. Or I'm like, I could have done it better and this and that. And that stayed with you, that character stayed with you a little bit. Totally, yeah. I just feel like with actors, sometimes when you listen to interviews, they have spent so much time sort of living inside other characters that they almost don't have a depth of personality themselves, like a depth. Like I don't mean that as a negative thing. It's just like, it feels like the art form at its best is pretending to be other people. And even pretending sounds negative, but like bringing certain characters to life. Yeah, yeah, embodying. A weird thing happened while we were doing Stooges because you've got a very heavy blueprint. We're following this very clear blueprint that the Stooges left for everybody. And for Stooge fans and people enjoying the movie, it's got to be this. You take your toolbox that you're used to bring into a comedy movie, you leave it behind. The only tools I'm bringing are the ones that he used. And a weird thing started happening where I would, I always saw the whole thing happening with the real Stooges in black and white. So if we're about to shoot a scene, I would just think about, I mean, aside from all the other preparation, you know everything and what you're supposed to do. And I've been watching so much of it. And the three of us are, we're pretty much left to come up with a lot of the striking combinations and all the stuff, which is all real smack and all this crap. And the stuff that we were doing that was very Stoogey, you're preparing all that stuff. But something else was happening before you jump into a scene and the unknown of now we're shooting it. And here are these parameters within to shoot the scene. I could still see it as them doing it. So much so that when I saw the movie at the premiere, I was like, who's this big fuck doing? Cause I'm not curly to me. Curly is curly. But I feel like. So you're seeing yourself in black and white almost. I was seeing him. Yeah, I was only seeing him. So channeling in some fundamental way. In some weird way, you're channeling him because you've seen so much of it. The only thing you know about Jerome Lester Horowitz is curly. I'm not saying he was exhumed or something or a spirit went in me or some weird, crystal mommy shit like that. I'm saying that this, because you know so much of it and because of the heavy blueprint that they left with you, you're channeling what that person does. And I was seeing entire scenes before you do them the way he would do it. And then you want a couple takes to make sure that you're doing it right. But that one was hard to let go of. Some of them are. Do you think Larry David, who was also in there dressed as a nun, also had trouble letting go of that? We mentioned clothes make the man think that worked for him in that case. Man, you know he. Was it like working with a guy? Come on, he's the greatest. And he's a big stooge, he's a stooge fan. And him and Pete Farrelly are good friends. But then Larry David has to show up and hang out with us for a couple weeks. He's like, I didn't realize it was gonna take this long. But shit, I gotta be out here in Atlanta, it's boiling hot. But at one point, there was this line where he kept doing, he would just spit a different line every time he was getting hit in the head with something and he's laying there on the ground. And he goes, he comes to and he says, at one point he goes, Miami audiences are the best audiences in the world, right? Because he's loopy. Now he's playing a nun at the orphanage where the three stooges grew up. And I'm super intimidated by Larry David, he's a genius and stuff. But I walk up to him and I go, so he's, what is he? Like a Borscht Belt Florida comedian who is on the lam? And so he's dressing as a woman, he ends up at an orphanage, like what's going on there? And he just, and he looks at me and he just goes, yeah. Like, I'm like, ah, he's got some like actor motivation. Like, of course he looks, it's Larry David in a nun's habit, which is hilarious. That's such a Pete Farrelly casting thing, it's, you know. And he, but he's doing this whole like, what a warm audience, you know, like, oh, he's like this Catskill comedian who's been living in, you know, both in return. Living through in his mind is just having fun with it, right? I mean, that and probably a combination of that and getting the lines right. Cause he's like, what are we doing here? What is, you know, just frustrated all day with what the heck we're trying to do. What do you think makes, I mean, that guy's one of the best improv people ever. So what do you think makes him so good?\",\n          \"The following is a conversation with Scott Aaronson, his second time on the podcast. He is a professor at UT Austin, director of the Quantum Information Center, and previously a professor at MIT. Last time we talked about quantum computing. This time we talk about computation complexity, consciousness, and theories of everything. I'm recording this intro, as you may be able to tell, in a very strange room in the middle of the night. I'm not really sure how I got here or how I'm going to get out, but Hunter S. Thompson saying I think applies to today and the last few days and actually the last couple of weeks. Life should not be a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body, but rather to skid in broadside in a cloud of smoke, thoroughly used up, totally worn out, and loudly proclaiming, wow, what a ride. So I figured whatever I'm up to here, and yes, lots of wine is involved, I'm going to have to improvise, have to improvise, have to improvise, hence this recording. Okay, quick mention of each sponsor, followed by some thoughts related to the episode. First sponsor is SimpliSafe, a home security company I use to monitor and protect my apartment, though of course I'm always prepared with a fall back plan, as a man in this world must always be. Second sponsor is 8sleep, a mattress that cools itself, measures heart rate variability, has a nap, and has given me yet another reason to look forward to sleep, including the all important power nap. Third sponsor is ExpressVPN, the VPN I've used for many years to protect my privacy on the internet.

The first one was with Steven Wolfram when it was actually sunny out, in this case it was raining, which is why I found a covered outdoor patio. But I learned a valuable lesson, which is that raindrops can be quite loud on the hard metal surface of a patio cover. I did my best with the audio, I hope it still sounds okay to you. I'm learning, always improving. In fact, as Scott says, if you always win, then you're probably doing something wrong. To be honest, I get pretty upset with myself when I fail, small or big, but I've learned that this feeling is priceless. It can be fuel, when channeled into concrete plans of how to improve. So if you enjoy this thing, subscribe on YouTube, review the Five Stars in Apple podcast, follow on Spotify, support on Patreon, or connect with me on Twitter at Lex Friedman. And now, here's my conversation with Scott Aaronson. Let's start with the most absurd question, but I've read you write some fascinating stuff about it, so let's go there. Are we living in a simulation? What difference does it make, Lex? I mean, I'm serious. What difference? Because if we are living in a simulation, it raises the question, how real does something have to be in simulation for it to be sufficiently immersive for us humans? But I mean, even in principle, how could we ever know if we were in one, right? A perfect simulation, by definition, is something that's indistinguishable from the real thing. Well, we didn't say anything about perfect. No, no, that's right. Well, if it was an imperfect simulation, if we could hack it, find a bug in it, then that would be one thing, right? If this was like The Matrix and there was a way for me to do flying kung fu moves or something by hacking the simulation, well then we would have to cross that bridge when we came to it, wouldn't we? At that point, it's hard to see the difference between that and just what people would ordinarily refer to as a world with miracles. What about from a different perspective, thinking about the universe as a computation, like a program running on a computer? That's kind of a neighboring concept. It is. It is an interesting and reasonably well defined question to ask, is the world computable? Does the world satisfy what we would call in CS the church touring thesis? That is, could we take any physical system and simulate it to any desired precision by a touring machine, given the appropriate input data, right? And so far, I think the indications are pretty strong that our world does seem to satisfy the church touring thesis. At least if it doesn't, then we haven't yet discovered why not. But now, does that mean that our universe is a simulation? Well, that word seems to suggest that there is some other larger universe in which it is running. And the problem there is that if the simulation is perfect, then we're never going to be able to get any direct evidence about that other universe. We will only be able to see the effects of the computation that is running in this universe. Well, let's imagine an analogy. Let's imagine a PC, a personal computer, a computer. Is it possible with the advent of artificial intelligence for the computer to look outside of itself to see, to understand its creator? I mean, that's a simple, is that a ridiculous analogy? Well, I mean, with the computers that we actually have, I mean, first of all, we all know that humans have done an imperfect job of enforcing the abstraction boundaries of computers, right? Like you may try to confine some program to a playpen, but as soon as there's one memory allocation error in the C program, then the program has gotten out of that playpen and it can do whatever it wants, right? This is how most hacks work, you know, viruses and worms and exploits. And, you know, you would have to imagine that an AI would be able to discover something like that. Now, you know, of course, if we could actually discover some exploit of reality itself, then, you know, then this whole, I mean, then in some sense we wouldn't have to philosophize about this, right? This would no longer be a metaphysical conversation. But the question is, what would that hack look like? Yeah, well, I have no idea. I mean, Peter Shor, you know, the very famous person in quantum computing, of course, has joked that maybe the reason why we haven't yet, you know, integrated general relativity in quantum mechanics is that, you know, the part of the universe that depends on both of them was actually left unspecified. And if we ever tried to do an experiment involving the singularity of a black hole or something like that, then, you know, the universe would just generate an overflow error or something, right? Yeah, we would just crash the universe. Now, you know, the universe, you know, has seemed to hold up pretty well for, you know, 14 billion years, right? So, you know, my, you know, a Occam's razor kind of guess has to be that, you know, it will continue to hold up, you know, that the fact that we don't know the laws of physics governing some phenomenon is not a strong sign that probing that phenomenon is going to crash the universe, right? But, you know, of course, I could be wrong. But do you think on the physics side of things, you know, there's been recently a few folks, Eric Weinstein and Stephen Wolfram that came out with a theory of everything. I think there's a history of physicists dreaming and working on the unification of all the laws of physics. Do you think it's possible that once we understand more physics, not necessarily the unification of the laws, but just understand physics more deeply at the fundamental level, we'll be able to start, you know, I mean, part of this is humorous, but looking to see if there's any bugs in the universe that could be exploited for, you know, traveling at not just speed of light, but just traveling faster than our current spaceships can travel, all that kind of stuff. Well, I mean, to travel faster than our current spaceships could travel, you wouldn't need to find any bug in the universe, right? The known laws of physics, you know, let us go much faster up to the speed of light, right? And, you know, when people want to go faster than the speed of light, well, we actually know something about what that would entail, namely that, you know, according to relativity, that seems to entail communication backwards in time. Okay, so then you have to worry about closed time like curves and all of that stuff. So, you know, in some sense, we sort of know the price that you have to pay for these things, right? But under the current understanding of physics. That's right. That's right. We can't, you know, say that they're impossible, but we, you know, we know that sort of a lot else in physics breaks, right? So, now regarding Eric Weinstein and Stephen Wolfram, like, I wouldn't say that either of them has a theory of everything. I would say that they have ideas that they hope, you know, could someday lead to a theory of everything. Is that a worthy pursuit? Well, I mean, certainly, let's say by theory of everything, you know, we don't literally mean a theory of cats and of baseball and, you know, but we just mean it in the more limited sense of everything, a fundamental theory of physics, right? Of all of the fundamental interactions of physics, of course, such a theory, even after we had it, you know, would leave the entire question of all the emergent behavior, right? You know, to be explored. So, it's only everything for a specific definition of everything. Okay, but in that sense, I would say, of course, that's worth pursuing. I mean, that is the entire program of fundamental physics, right? All of my friends who do quantum gravity, who do string theory, who do anything like that, that is what's motivating them. Yeah, it's funny, though, but, I mean, Eric Weinstein talks about this. It is, I don't know much about the physics world, but I know about the AI world, and it is a little, it is a little bit taboo to talk about AGI, for example, on the AI side. So, really, to talk about the big dream of the community, I would say, because it seems so far away, it's almost taboo to bring it up, because, you know, it's seen as the kind of people that dream about creating a truly superhuman level intelligence. That's really far out there, people, because we're not even close to that. And it feels like the same thing is true for the physics community. I mean, Stephen Hawking certainly talked constantly about theory of everything, right? You know, I mean, people, you know, use those terms who were, you know, some of the most respected people in the whole world of physics, right? But, I mean, I think that the distinction that I would make is that people might react badly if you use the term in a way that suggests that you, you know, thinking about it for five minutes, have come up with this major new insight about it, right? It's difficult. Stephen Hawking is not a great example, because I think you can do whatever the heck you want when you get to that level. And I certainly see, like, senior faculty, you know, that, you know, at that point, that's one of the nice things about getting older is you stop giving a damn. But community as a whole, they tend to roll their eyes very quickly at stuff that's outside the quote unquote mainstream. Well, let me put it this way. I mean, if you asked, you know, Ed Witten, let's say, who is, you know, you might consider the leader of the string community, and thus, you know, very, very mainstream, in a certain sense, but he would have no hesitation in saying, you know, of course, you know, they're looking for a, you know, you know, a unified description of nature of, you know, of general relativity of quantum mechanics of all the fundamental interactions of nature, right? Now, you know, whether people would call that a theory of everything, whether they would use that term, that might vary. You know, Lenny Susskind would definitely have no problem telling you that, you know, if that's what we want, right? TK For me, who loves human beings and psychology, it's kind of ridiculous to say a theory that unifies the laws of physics gets you to understand everything. I would say you're not even close to understanding everything. TK Yeah, right. I mean, the word everything is a little ambiguous here. And then people will get into debates about, you know, reductionism versus emergentism and blah, blah, blah. And so in not wanting to say theory of everything, people might just be trying to short circuit that debate and say, you know, look, you know, yes, we want a fundamental theory of, you know, the particles and interactions of nature. TK Let me bring up the next topic that people don't want to mention, although they're getting more comfortable with it, is consciousness. You mentioned that you have a talk on consciousness that I watched five minutes of, but the internet connection was really bad. TK Was this my talk about, you know, refuting the integrated information theory? TK Yes. TK Which was a particular account of consciousness that, yeah, I think one can just show it doesn't work. Much harder to say what does work. TK Let me ask, maybe it'd be nice to comment on, you talk about also like the semi hard problem of consciousness or like almost hard problem or kind of hard. TK Pretty hard problem, I think I call it. TK So maybe can you talk about that, their idea of the approach to modeling consciousness and why you don't find it convincing? What is it, first of all? TK Okay, well, so what I called the pretty hard problem of consciousness, this is my term, although many other people have said something equivalent to this, okay? But it's just, you know, the problem of, you know, giving an account of just which physical systems are conscious and which are not. Or, you know, if there are degrees of consciousness, then quantifying how conscious a given system is. TK Oh, awesome. So that's the pretty hard problem. TK Yeah, that's what I mean. TK That's it. I'm adopting it. I love it. That's a good ring to it. TK And so, you know, the infamous hard problem of consciousness is to explain how something like consciousness could arise at all, you know, in a material universe, right? Or, you know, why does it ever feel like anything to experience anything, right? And, you know, so I'm trying to distinguish from that problem, right? And say, you know, no, okay, I would merely settle for an account that could say, you know, is a fetus conscious? You know, if so, at which trimester? You know, is a dog conscious? You know, what about a frog, right? TK Or even as a precondition, you take that both these things are conscious, tell me which is more conscious. TK Yeah, for example, yes. Yeah, yeah. I mean, if consciousness is some multidimensional vector, well, just tell me in which respects these things are conscious and in which respect they aren't, right? And, you know, and have some principled way to do it where you're not, you know, carving out exceptions for things that you like or don't like, but could somehow take a description of an arbitrary physical system, and then just based on the physical properties of that system, or the informational properties, or how it's connected, or something like that, just in principle, calculate, you know, its degree of consciousness, right? I mean, this, this would be the kind of thing that we would need, you know, if we wanted to address questions, like, you know, what does it take for a machine to be conscious, right? Or when are, you know, when should we regard AIs as being conscious? So now this IIT, this integrated information theory, which has been put forward by Giulio Tinoni and a bunch of his collaborators over the last decade or two, this is noteworthy, I guess, as a direct attempt to answer that question, to, you know, answer the, to address the pretty hard problem, right? And they give a, a criterion that's just based on how a system is connected. So you, so it's up to you to sort of abstract the system, like a brain or a microchip, as a collection of components that are connected to each other by some pattern of connections, you know, and, and to specify how the components can influence each other, you know, like where the inputs go, you know, where they affect the outputs. But then once you've specified that, then they give this quantity that they call phi, you know, the Greek letter phi. And the definition of phi has actually changed over time. It changes from one paper to another, but in all of the variations, it involves something about what we in computer science would call graph expansion. So basically what this means is that they want, in order to get a large value of phi, it should not be possible to take your system and partition it into two components that are only weakly connected to each other. Okay. So whenever we take our system and sort of try to split it up into two, then there should be lots and lots of connections going between the two components. Okay. Well, I understand what that means on a graph. Do they formalize what, how to construct such a graph or data structure, whatever, or is this one of the criticism I've heard you kind of say is that a lot of the very interesting specifics are usually communicated through like natural language, like through words. So it's like the details aren't always clear. Well, it's true. I mean, they have nothing even resembling a derivation of this phi. Okay. So what they do is they state a whole bunch of postulates, you know, axioms that they think that consciousness should satisfy. And then there's some verbal discussion. And then at some point, phi appears. Right. Right. And this, this was what the first thing that really made the hair stand on my neck, to be honest, because they are acting as if there is a derivation. They're acting as if, you know, you're supposed to think that this is a derivation and there's nothing even remotely resembling a derivate. They just pull the phi out of a hat completely. Is one of the key criticisms to you is that details are missing or is there something more fundamental? That's not even the key criticism. That's just, that's just a side point. Okay. The, the core of it is that I think that the, you know, that they want to say that a system is more conscious the larger its value of phi. And I think that that is obvious nonsense. Okay. As soon as you think about it for like a minute, as soon as you think about it in terms of, could I it's like finding out where babies come from. It's like that level of, you know, why didn't anyone tell me this before, right? But I thought, okay, this is just the beginning. Now I know how to write a basic program, but, you know, really write an interesting program, like, you know, a video game, which had always been my dream as a kid to, you know, create my own Nintendo games, right? You know, but, you know, obviously I'm going to need to learn some way more complicated form of programming than that. Okay. But, you know, eventually I learned this incredible idea of universality. And that says that, no, you throw in a few rules and then you already have enough to express everything. Okay. So for example, the AND, the OR and the NOT gate can all, or in fact, even just the AND and the NOT gate, or even just the NAND gate, for example, is already enough to express any Boolean function on any number of bits. You just have to string together enough of them. You can build a universe with NAND gates. You can build the universe out of NAND gates. Yeah. You know, the simple instructions of BASIC are already enough, at least in principle, you know, if we ignore details like how much memory can be accessed and stuff like that, that is enough to express what could be expressed by any programming language whatsoever. And the way to prove that is very simple. We simply need to show that in BASIC or whatever, we could write an interpreter or a compiler for whatever other programming language we care about, like C or Java or whatever. And as soon as we had done that, then ipso facto, anything that's expressible in C or Java is also expressible in BASIC. Okay. And so this idea of universality, you know, goes back at least to Alan Turing in the 1930s when, you know, he wrote down this incredibly simple pared down model of a computer, the Turing machine, right, which, you know, he pared down the instruction set to just read a symbol, you know, write a symbol, move to the left, move to the right, halt, change your internal state, right? That's it. Okay. And anybody proved that, you know, this could simulate all kinds of other things, you know, and so in fact, today we would say, well, we would call it a Turing universal model of computation that is, you know, just as it has just the same expressive power that BASIC or Java or C++ or any of those other languages have because anything in those other languages could be compiled down to Turing machine. Now, Turing also proved a different related thing, which is that there is a single Turing machine that can simulate any other Turing machine if you just describe that other machine on its tape, right? And likewise, there is a single Turing machine that will run any C program, you know, if you just put it on its tape. That's a second meaning of universality. First of all, he couldn't visualize it and that was in the 30s. Yeah, the 30s. That's right. That's before computers really, I mean, I don't know how, I wonder what that felt like, you know, learning that there's no Santa Claus or something. Because I don't know if that's empowering or paralyzing because it doesn't give you any, it's like you can't write a software engineering book and make that the first chapter and say we're done. Well, I mean, right. I mean, in one sense, it was this enormous flattening of the universe. Yes. I had imagined that there was going to be some infinite hierarchy of more and more powerful programming languages, you know, and then I kicked myself for having such a stupid idea. But apparently, G\\u00f6del had had the same conjecture in the 30s. Oh, good. You're in good company. Yeah. And then G\\u00f6del read Turing's paper and he kicked himself and he said, yeah, I was completely wrong about that. But I had thought that maybe where I can contribute will be to invent a new more powerful programming language that lets you express things that could never be expressed in BASIC. And how would you do that? Obviously, you couldn't do it itself in BASIC. But there is this incredible flattening that happens once you learn what is universality. But then it's also an opportunity because it means once you know these rules, then the sky is the limit, right? Then you have kind of the same weapons at your disposal that the world's greatest programmer has. It's now all just a question of how you wield them. Right. Exactly. So every problem is solvable, but some problems are harder than others. Well, yeah, there's the question of how much time, you know, of how hard is it to write a program? And then there's also the questions of what resources does the program need? You know, how much time, how much memory? Those are much more complicated questions. Of course, ones that we're still struggling with today. Exactly. So you've, I don't know if you created Complexity Zoo or... I did create the Complexity Zoo. What is it? What's complexity? Oh, all right, all right, all right. Complexity theory is the study of sort of the inherent resources needed to solve computational problems, okay? So it's easiest to give an example. Like, let's say we want to add two numbers, right? If I want to add them, you know, if the numbers are twice as long, then it only, it will take me twice as long to add them, but only twice as long, right? It's no worse than that. Or a computer. For a computer or for a person. We're using pencil and paper, for that matter. If you have a good algorithm. Yeah, that's right. I mean, even if you just use the elementary school algorithm of just carrying, you know, then it takes time that is linear in the length of the numbers, right? Now, multiplication, if you use the elementary school algorithm, is harder because you have to multiply each digit of the first number by each digit of the second one. And then deal with all the carries. So that's what we call a quadratic time algorithm, right? If the numbers become twice as long, now you need four times as much time, okay? So now, as it turns out, people discovered much faster ways to multiply numbers using computers. And today we know how to multiply two numbers that are n digits long using a number of steps that's nearly linear in n. These are questions you can ask. But now, let's think about a different thing that people, you know, they've encountered in elementary school, factoring a number. Okay? Take a number and find its prime factors, right? And here, you know, if I give you a number with ten digits, I ask you for its prime factors. Well, maybe it's even, so you know that two is a factor. You know, maybe it ends in zero, so you know that ten is a factor, right? But, you know, other than a few obvious things like that, you know, if the prime factors are all very large, then it's not clear how you even get started, right? You know, it seems like you have to do an exhaustive search among an enormous number of factors. Now, and as many people might know, for better or worse, the security, you know, of most of the encryption that we currently use to protect the internet is based on the belief, and this is not a theorem, it's a belief, that factoring is an inherently hard problem for our computers. We do know algorithms that are better than just trial division, than just trying all the possible divisors, but they are still basically exponential. And exponential is hard. Yeah, exactly. So the fastest algorithms that anyone has discovered, at least publicly discovered, you know, I'm assuming that the NSA doesn't know something better, okay? But they take time that basically grows exponentially with the cube root of the size of the number that you're factoring, right? So that cube root, that's the part that takes all the cleverness, okay? But there's still an exponential. There's still an exponentiality there. But what that means is that, like, when people use a thousand bit keys for their cryptography, that can probably be broken using the resources of the NSA or the world's other intelligence agencies. You know, people have done analyses that say, you know, with a few hundred million dollars of computer power, they could totally do this. And if you look at the documents that Snowden released, you know, it looks a lot like they are doing that or something like that. It would kind of be surprising if they weren't, okay? But, you know, if that's true, then in some ways that's reassuring. Because if that's the best that they can do, then that would say that they can't break 2,000 bit numbers, right? Then 2,000 bit numbers would be beyond what even they could do. They haven't found an efficient algorithm. That's where all the worries and the concerns of quantum computing came in, that there could be some kind of shortcut around that. Right. So complexity theory is a huge part of, let's say, the theoretical core of computer science. You know, it started in the 60s and 70s as, you know, sort of an autonomous field. So it was, you know, already, you know, I mean, you know, it was well developed even by the time that I was born, okay? But in 2002, I made a website called the Complexity Zoo, to answer your question, where I just tried to catalog the different complexity classes, which are classes of problems that are solvable with different kinds of resources, okay? So these are kind of, you know, you could think of complexity classes as like being almost to theoretical computer science, like what the elements are to chemistry, right? They're sort of, you know, there are our most basic objects in a certain way. I feel like the elements have a characteristic to them where you can't just add an infinite number. Well, you could, but beyond a certain point, they become unstable, right? Right. So it's like, you know, in theory, you can have atoms with, you know, and look, look, I mean, I mean, a neutron star, you know, is a nucleus with, you know, uncalled billions of neutrons in it, of hadrons in it, okay? But, you know, for sort of normal atoms, right, probably you can't get much above a hundred atomic weight, 150 or so, or sorry, sorry, I mean, beyond 150 or so protons without it, you know, very quickly fissioning. With complexity classes, well, yeah, you can have an infinity of complexity classes, but, you know, maybe there's only a finite number of them that are particularly interesting, right? Just like with anything else, you know, you care about some more than about others. So what kind of interesting classes are there? I mean, you could have just, maybe say, what are the, if you take any kind of computer science class, what are the classes you learn? Good. Let me tell you sort of the biggest ones, the ones that you would learn first. So, you know, first of all, there is P, that's what it's called, okay? It stands for polynomial time. And this is just the class of all of the problems that you could solve with a conventional computer, like your iPhone or your laptop, you know, by a completely deterministic algorithm, right? Using a number of steps that grows only like the size of the input raised to some fixed power, okay? So, if your algorithm is linear time, like, you know, for adding numbers, okay, that problem is in P. If you have an algorithm that's quadratic time, like the elementary school algorithm for multiplying two numbers, that's also in P, even if it was the size of the input to the 10th power or to the 50th power, well, that wouldn't be very good in practice. But, you know, formally, we would still count that, that would still be in P, okay? But if your algorithm takes exponential time, meaning like if every time I add one more data point to your input, if the time needed by the algorithm doubles, if you need time like two to the power of the amount of input data, then that we call an exponential time algorithm, okay? And that is not polynomial, okay? So, P is all of the problems that have some polynomial time algorithm, okay? So, that includes most of what we do with our computers on a day to day basis, you know, all the, you know, sorting, basic arithmetic, you know, whatever is going on in your email reader or in Angry Birds, okay? It's all in P. Then the next super important class is called NP. That stands for non deterministic polynomial, okay? It does not stand for not polynomial, which is a common confusion. But NP was basically all of the problems where if there is a solution, then it is easy to check the solution if someone shows it to you, okay? So, actually a perfect example of a problem in NP is factoring, the one I told you about before. Like if I gave you a number with thousands of digits and I told you that, you know, I asked you, does this have at least three non trivial divisors, right? That might be a super hard problem to solve, right? It might take you millions of years using any algorithm that's known, at least running on our existing computers, okay? But if I simply showed you the divisors, I said, here are three divisors of this number, then it would be very easy for you to ask your computer to just check each one and see if it works. Just divide it in, see if there's any remainder, right? And if they all go in, then you've checked. Well, I guess there were, right? So any problem where, you know, wherever there's a solution, there is a short witness that can be easily, like a polynomial size witness that can be checked in polynomial time, that we call an NP problem, okay? And yeah, so every problem that's in P is also in NP, right? Because, you know, you could always just ignore the witness and just, you know, if a problem is in P, you can just solve it yourself, okay? But now, in some sense, the central, you know, mystery of theoretical computer science is every NP problem in P. So if you can easily check the answer to a computational problem, does that mean that you can also easily find the answer? Even though there's all these problems that appear to be very difficult to find the answer, it's still an open question whether a good answer exists. Because no one has proven that there's no way to do it. It's arguably the most, I don't know, the most famous, the most maybe interesting, maybe you disagree with that, problem in theoretical computer science. So what's your The most famous, for sure. P equals NP. If you were to bet all your money, where do you put your money? That's an easy one. P is not equal to NP. I like to say that if we were physicists, we would have just declared that to be a law of nature, you know, just like thermodynamics. That's hilarious. Given ourselves Nobel Prizes for its discovery. Yeah, you know, and look, if later it turned out that we were wrong, we just give ourselves more Nobel Prizes. So harsh, but so true. I mean, no, I mean, I mean, it's really just because we are mathematicians or descended from mathematicians, you know, we have to call things conjectures that other people would just call empirical facts or discoveries, right? But one shouldn't read more into that difference in language, you know, about the underlying truth. So, okay, so you're a good investor and good spender of money. So then let me ask another way. Is it possible at all? And what would that look like if P indeed equals NP? Well, I do think that it's possible. I mean, in fact, you know, when people really pressed me on my blog for what odds would I put, I put, you know, two or three percent odds. Wow, that's pretty good. That P equals NP. Yeah. Well, because, you know, when P, I mean, you really have to think about, like, if there were 50, you know, mysteries like P versus NP, and if I made a guess about every single one of them, would I expect to be right 50 times? Right? And the truthful answer is no. Okay. Yeah. So, you know, and that's what you really mean in saying that, you know, you have, you know, better than 98% odds for something. Okay. But so, yeah, you know, I mean, there could certainly be surprises. And look, if P equals NP, well, then there would be the further question of, you know, is the algorithm actually efficient in practice? Right? I mean, Don Knuth, who I know that you've interviewed as well, right, he likes to conjecture that P equals NP, but that the algorithm is so inefficient that it doesn't matter anyway. Right? No, I don't know. I've listened to him say that. I don't know whether he says that just because he has an actual reason for thinking it's true or just because it sounds cool. Yeah. Okay. But, you know, that's a logical possibility, right, that the algorithm could be n to the 10,000 time, or it could even just be n squared time, but with a leading constant of, it could be a Google times n squared or something like that. And in that case, the fact that P equals NP, well, it would ravage the whole theory of complexity. We would have to rebuild from the ground up. But in practical terms, it might mean very little, right, if the algorithm was too inefficient to run. If the algorithm could actually be run in practice, like if it had small enough constants, or if you could improve it to where it had small enough constants that was efficient in practice, then that would change the world. Okay? You think it would have, like, what kind of impact would it have? Well, okay, I mean, here's an example. I mean, you could, well, okay, just for starters, you could break basically all of the encryption that people use to protect the internet. That's just for starters. You could break Bitcoin and every other cryptocurrency, or, you know, mine as much Bitcoin as you wanted, right? You know, become a super duper billionaire, right? And then plot your next move. Right. That's just for starters. That's a good point. Now, your next move might be something like, you know, you now have, like, a theoretically optimal way to train any neural network, to find parameters for any neural network, right? So you could now say, like, is there any small neural network that generates the entire content of Wikipedia, right? If, you know, and now the question is not, can you find it? The question has been reduced to, does that exist or not? If it does exist, then the answer would be, yes, you can find it, okay? If you had this algorithm in your hands, okay? You could ask your computer, you know, I mean, P versus NP is one of these seven problems that carries this million dollar prize from the Clay Foundation. You know, if you solve it, you know, and others are the Riemann hypothesis, the Poincare conjecture, which was solved, although the solver turned down the prize, right, and four others. But what I like to say, the way that we can see that P versus NP is the biggest of all of these questions is that if you had this fast algorithm, then you could solve all seven of them, okay? You just ask your computer, you know, is there a short proof of the Riemann hypothesis, right? You know, that a machine could, in a language where a machine could verify it, and provided that such a proof exists, then your computer finds it in a short amount of time without having to do a brute force search, okay? So, I mean, those are the stakes of what we're talking about. But I hope that also helps to give your listeners some intuition of why I and most of my colleagues would put our money on P not equaling NP. Is it possible, I apologize this is a really dumb question, but is it possible to, that a proof will come out that P equals NP, but an algorithm that makes P equals NP is impossible to find? Is that like crazy? Okay, well, if P equals NP, it would mean that there is such an algorithm. That it exists, yeah. But, you know, it would mean that it exists. Now, you know, in practice, normally the way that we would prove anything like that would be by finding the algorithm. But there is such a thing as a nonconstructive proof that an algorithm exists. You know, this has really only reared its head, I think, a few times in the history of our field, right? But, you know, it is theoretically possible that such a thing could happen. But, you know, there are, even here, there are some amusing observations that one could make. So there is this famous observation of Leonid Levin, who was, you know, one of the original discoverers of NP completeness, right? And he said, we'll consider the following algorithm that I guarantee will solve the NP problems efficiently, just as provided that P equals NP, okay? Here is what it does. It just runs, you know, it enumerates every possible algorithm in a gigantic infinite list, right? From like in like alphabetical order, right? You know, and many of them maybe won't even compile, so we just ignore those, okay? But now, we just, you know, run the first algorithm, then we run the second algorithm, we run the first one a little bit more, then we run the first three algorithms for a while, we run the first four for a while. This is called dovetailing, by the way. This is a known trick in theoretical computer science, okay? But we do it in such a way that, you know, whatever is the algorithm out there in our list that solves NP complete, you know, the NP problems efficiently, will eventually hit that one, right? And now, the key is that whenever we hit that one, you know, by assumption, it has to solve the problem, it has to find the solution, and once it claims to find a solution, then we can check that ourselves, right? Because these are NP problems, then we can check it. Now, this is utterly impractical, right? You know, you'd have to do this enormous exhaustive search among all the algorithms, but from a certain theoretical standpoint, that is merely a constant prefactor, right? That's merely a multiplier of your running time. So, there are tricks like that one can do to say that, in some sense, the algorithm would have to be constructive. But, you know, in the human sense, you know, it is possible that to, you know, it's conceivable that one could prove such a thing via a nonconstructive method. Is that likely? I don't think so. Not personally. So, that's P and NP, but the complexity zoo is full of wonderful creatures. Well, it's got about 500 of them. 500. So, how do you get, yeah, how do you get more? I mean, just for starters, there is everything that we could do with a conventional computer with a polynomial amount of memory, okay, but possibly an exponential amount of time, because we get to reuse the same memory over and over again. Okay, that is called P space, okay? And that's actually, we think, an even larger class than NP. Okay, well, P is contained in NP, which is contained in P space. And we think that those containments are strict. And the constraint there is on the memory. The memory has to grow polynomially with the size of the process. That's right. That's right. But in P space, we now have interesting things that were not in NP, like as a famous example, you know, from a given position in chess, you know, does white or black have the win? Let's say, assuming provided that the game lasts only for a reasonable number of moves, okay? Or likewise, for go, okay? And, you know, even for the generalizations of these games to arbitrary size boards, because with an eight by eight board, you could say that's just a constant size problem. You just, you know, in principle, you just solve it in O of one time, right? But so we really mean the generalizations of, you know, games to arbitrary size boards here. Or another thing in P space would be, like, I give you some really hard constraint satisfaction problem, like, you know, a traveling salesperson or, you know, packing boxes into the trunk of your car or something like that. And I ask, not just is there a solution, which would be an NP problem, but I ask how many solutions are there, okay? That, you know, count the number of valid solutions. That actually gives, those problems lie in a complexity class called sharp P, or like, it looks like hashtag, like hashtag P, okay, which sits between NP and P space. There's all the problems that you can do in exponential time, okay? That's called exp. So, and by the way, it was proven in the 60s that exp is larger than P, okay? So we know that much. We know that there are problems that are solvable in exponential time that are not solvable in polynomial time, okay? In fact, we even know, we know that there are problems that are solvable in n cubed time that are not solvable in n squared time. And that, those don't help us with a controversy between P and NP at all. Unfortunately, it seems not, or certainly not yet, right? The techniques that we use to establish those things, they're very, very related to how Turing proved the unsolvability of the halting problem, but they seem to break down when we're comparing two different resources, like time versus space, or like, you know, P versus NP, okay? But, you know, I mean, there's what you can do with a randomized algorithm, right? That can be done with a random algorithm, right? That can sometimes, you know, has some probability of making a mistake. That's called BPP, bounded error probabilistic polynomial time. And then, of course, there's one that's very close to my own heart, what you can efficiently do in polynomial time using a quantum computer, okay? And that's called BQP, right? And so, you know, what's understood about it? Okay, so P is contained in BPP, which is contained in BQP, which is contained in P space, okay? So anything you can, in fact, in something very similar to sharp P. BQP is basically, you know, well, it's contained in like P with the magic power to solve sharp P problems, okay? Why is BQP contained in P space? Oh, that's an excellent question. So there is, well, I mean, one has to prove that, okay? But the proof, you could think of it as using Richard Feynman's picture of quantum mechanics, which is that you can always, you know, we haven't really talked about quantum mechanics in this conversation. We did in our previous one. Yeah, we did last time. But yeah, we did last time, okay? But basically, you could always think of a quantum computation as like a branching tree of possibilities where each possible path that you could take through, you know, the space has a complex number attached to it called an amplitude, okay? And now the rule is, you know, when you make a measurement at the end, well, you see a random answer, okay? But quantum mechanics is all about calculating the probability that you're going to see one potential answer versus another one, right? And the rule for calculating the probability that you'll see some answer is that you have to add up the amplitudes for all of the paths that could have led to that answer. And then, you know, that's a complex number, so that, you know, how could that be a probability? Then you take the squared absolute value of the result. That gives you a number between zero and one, okay? So yeah, I just summarized quantum mechanics in like 30 seconds, okay? But now, you know, what this already tells us is that anything I can do with a quantum computer, I could simulate with a classical computer if I only have exponentially more time, okay? And why is that? Because if I have exponential time, I could just write down this entire branching tree and just explicitly calculate each of these amplitudes, right? You know, that will be very inefficient, but it will work, right? It's enough to show that quantum computers could not solve the halting problem or, you know, they could never do anything that is literally uncomputable in Turing's sense, okay? But now, as I said, there's even a stronger result which says that BQP is contained in PSPACE. The way that we prove that is that we say, if all I want is to calculate the probability of some particular output happening, you know, which is all I need to simulate a quantum computer, really, then I don't need to write down the entire quantum state, which is an exponentially large object. All I need to do is just calculate what is the amplitude for that final state. And to do that, I just have to sum up all the amplitudes that lead to that state. Okay, so that's an exponentially large sum, but I can calculate it just reusing the same memory over and over for each term in the sum. And hence the p, in the PSPACE? Hence the PSPACE. Yeah. So what, out of that whole complexity zoo, and it could be BQP, what do you find is the most, the class that captured your heart the most, the most beautiful class that's just, yeah. I used, as my email address, bqpqpoly at gmail.com. Yes, because BQP slash Qpoly, well, you know, amazingly no one had taken it. Amazing, amazing. But, you know, this is a class that I was involved in sort of defining, proving the first theorems about in 2003 or so. So it was kind of close to my heart. But this is like, if we extended BQP, which is the class of everything we can do efficiently with a quantum computer, to allow quantum advice, which means imagine that you had some special initial state, okay, that could somehow help you do computation. And maybe such a state would be exponentially hard to prepare, okay, but maybe somehow these states were formed in the Big Bang or something, and they've just been sitting around ever since, right? If you found one, and if this state could be like ultra power, there are no limits on how powerful it could be, except that this state doesn't know in advance which input you've got, right? It only knows the size of your input. You know, and that's BQP slash Qpoly. So that's one that I just personally happen to love, okay? But, you know, if you're asking like what's the, you know, there's a class that I think is way more beautiful or fundamental than a lot of people even within this field realize that it is. That class is called SZK, or Statistical Zero Knowledge. And, you know, there's a very, very easy way to define this class, which is to say, suppose that I have two algorithms that each sample from probability distributions, right? So each one just outputs random samples according to, you know, possibly different distributions. And now the question I ask is, you know, let's say distributions over strings of n bits, you know, so over an exponentially large space. Now I ask, are these two distributions close or far as close or far as probability distributions? Okay. Any problem that can be reduced to that, you know, that can be put into that form is an SZK problem. And the way that this class was originally discovered was completely different from that and was kind of more complicated. It was discovered as the class of all of the problems that have a certain kind of what's called zero knowledge proof. Zero knowledge proofs are one of the central ideas in cryptography. You know, Shafi Goldwasser and Silvio McCauley won the Turing Award for, you know, inventing them. And they're at the core of even some cryptocurrencies that, you know, people use nowadays. But zero knowledge proofs are ways of proving to someone that something is true, like, you know, that there is a solution to this, you know, optimization problem or that these two graphs are isomorphic to each other or something, but without revealing why it's true, without revealing anything about why it's true. Okay. SZK is all of the problems for which there is such a proof that doesn't rely on any cryptography. Okay. And if you wonder, like, how could such a thing possibly exist, right? Well, like, imagine that I had two graphs and I wanted to convince you that these two graphs are not isomorphic, meaning, you know, I cannot permute one of them so that it's the same as the other one, right? You know, that might be a very hard statement to prove, right? I might need, you know, you might have to do a very exhaustive enumeration of, you know, all the different permutations before you were convinced that it was true. But what if there were some all knowing wizard that said to you, look, I'll tell you what, just pick one of the graphs randomly, then randomly permute it, then send it to me and I will tell you which graph you started with. Okay. And I will do that every single time. Right. And let's say that that wizard did that a hundred times and it was right every time. Yeah. Right. Now, if the graphs were isomorphic, then, you know, it would have been flipping a coin each time, right? It would have had only a one and two to the 100 power chance of, you know, of guessing right each time. But, you know, so, so if it's right every time, then now you're statistically convinced that these graphs are not isomorphic, even though you've learned nothing new about why they aren't. So fascinating. So yeah. So, so SDK is all of the problems that have protocols like that one, but it has this beautiful other characterization. It's shown up again and again in my, in my own work and, you know, a lot of people's work. And I think that it really is one of the most fundamental classes. It's just that people didn't realize that when it was first discovered. So we're living in the middle of a pandemic currently. Yeah. How has your life been changed or no better to ask, like, how has your perspective of the world change with this world changing event of a pandemic overtaking the entire world? Yeah. Well, I mean, I mean, all of our lives have changed, you know, like, I guess, as with no other event since I was born, you know, you would have to go back to world war II for something, I think of this magnitude, you know, on, you know, the way that we live our lives as for how it has changed my worldview. I think that the, the failure of institutions, you know, like, like, like the CDC, like, you know, other institutions that we sort of thought were, were trustworthy, like a lot of the media was staggering, was, was absolutely breathtaking. It is something that I would not have predicted. Right. I think I, I wrote on my blog that, you know, the, you know, it's, it's, it's fascinating to like rewatch the movie Contagion from a decade ago, right. That correctly foresaw so many aspects of, you know, what was going on, you know, an airborne, you know, virus originates in China, spreads to, you know, much of the world, you know, shuts everything down until a vaccine can be developed. You know, everyone has to stay at home, you know, you know, it gets, you know, an enormous number of things, right. Okay. But the one thing that they could not imagine, you know, is that like in this movie, everyone from the government is like hyper competent, hyper, you know, dedicated to the public good, right. And you know, yeah, they're the, they're the best of the best, you know, they could, you know, and, and there are these conspiracy theorists, right. Who think, you know, you know, this is all fake news. There's no, there's not really a pandemic. And those are some random people on the internet who the hyper competent government people have to, you know, oppose, right. They, you know, in, in trying to envision the worst thing that could happen, like, you know, the, the, there was a failure of imagination. The movie makers did not imagine that the conspiracy theorists and the, you know, and the incompetence and the nutcases would have captured our institutions and be the ones actually running things. So you had a certain, I love competence in all walks of life. I love, I get so much energy. I'm so excited by people who do amazing job. And I like you, or maybe you can clarify, but I had maybe not intuition, but I hope that government at its best could be ultra competent. What, first of all, two questions, like how do you explain the lack of confidence and the other, maybe on the positive side, how can we build a more competent government? Well, there's an election in two months. I mean, you have a faith that the election, I, you know, it's not going to fix everything, but you know, it's like, I feel like there is a ship that is sinking and you could at least stop the sinking. But, you know, I think that there are much, much deeper problems. I mean, I think that, you know, it is plausible to me that, you know, a lot of the failures, you know, with the CDC, with some of the other health agencies, even, you know, predate Trump, you know, predate the, you know, right wing populism that has sort of taken over much of the world now. And, you know, I think that, you know, it is, you know, it is very, I'm actually, you know, I've actually been strongly in favor of, you know, rushing vaccines of, you know, I thought that we could have done, you know, human challenge trials, you know, which were not done, right? We could have, you know, like had, you know, volunteers, you know, to actually, you know, be, you know, get vaccines, get, you know, exposed to COVID. So innovative ways of accelerating what we've done previously over a long time. I thought that, you know, each month that a vaccine is closer is like trillions of dollars. Are you surprised? And of course, lives, you know, at least, you know, hundreds of thousands of lives. Are you surprised that it's taking this long? We still don't have a plan. There's still not a feeling like anyone is actually doing anything in terms of alleviating, like any kind of plan. So there's a bunch of stuff, there's vaccine, but you could also do a testing infrastructure where everybody's tested nonstop with contact tracing, all that kind of. Well, I mean, I'm as surprised as almost everyone else. I mean, this is a historic failure. It is one of the biggest failures in the 240 year history of the United States, right? And we should be, you know, crystal clear about that. And, you know, one thing that I think has been missing, you know, even from the more competent side is like, you know, is sort of the World War II mentality, right? The, you know, the mentality of, you know, let's just, you know, you know, if we can, by breaking a whole bunch of rules, you know, get a vaccine and, you know, and even half the amount of time as we thought, then let's just do that because, you know, like we have to weigh all of the moral qualms that we have about doing that against the moral qualms of not doing. And one key little aspect to that that's deeply important to me, and we'll go into that topic next, is the World War II mentality wasn't just about, you know, breaking all the rules to get the job done. There was a togetherness to it. So I would, if I were president right now, it seems quite elementary to unite the country because we're facing a crisis. It's easy to make the virus the enemy. And it's very surprising to me that the division has increased as opposed to decrease. That's heartbreaking. Yeah. Well, look, I mean, it's been said by others that this is the first time in the country's history that we have a president who does not even pretend to, you know, want to unite the country. I mean, Lincoln, who fought a civil war, said he wanted to unite the country. And I do worry enormously about what happens if the results of this election are contested. And will there be violence as a result of that? And will we have a clear path of succession? And, you know, look, I mean, you know, this is all we're going to find out the answers to this in two months. And if none of that happens, maybe I'll look foolish. But I am willing to go on the record and say, I am terrified about that. Yeah, I've been reading The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich. So if I can, this is like one little voice just to put out there that I think November will be a really critical month for people to breathe and put love out there. Do not, you know, anger in those in that context, no matter who wins, no matter what is said, will destroy our country, may destroy our country, may destroy the world because of the power of the country. So it's really important to be patient, loving, empathetic. Like one of the things that troubles me is that even people on the left are unable to have a love and respect for people who voted for Trump. They can't imagine that there's good people that could vote for the opposite side. Oh, I know there are because I know some of them, right? I mean, you know, it's still, you know, maybe it baffles me, but, you know, I know such people. Let me ask you this. It's also heartbreaking to me on the topic of cancel culture. So in the machine learning community, I've seen it a little bit that there's aggressive attacking of people who are trying to have a nuanced conversation about things. And it's troubling because it feels like nuanced conversation is the only way to talk about difficult topics. And when there's a thought police and speech police on any nuanced conversation that everybody has to like in a animal farm chant that racism is bad and sexism is bad, which is things that everybody believes and they can't possibly say anything nuanced. It feels like it goes against any kind of progress from my kind of shallow perspective. But you've written a little bit about cancel culture. Do you have thoughts there? Well, I mean, to say that I am opposed to, you know, this trend of cancellations or of shouting people down rather than engaging them, that would be a massive understatement, right? And I feel like, you know, I have put my money where my mouth is, you know, not as much as some people have, but, you know, I've tried to do something. I mean, I have defended, you know, some unpopular people and unpopular, you know, ideas on my blog. I've, you know, tried to defend, you know, norms of open discourse, of, you know, reasoning with our opponents, even when I've been shouted down for that on social media, you know, called a racist, called a sexist, all of those things. And which, by the way, I should say, you know, I would be perfectly happy to, you know, if we had time to say, you know, you know, 10,000 times, you know, my hatred of racism, of sexism, of homophobia, right? But what I don't want to do is to cede to some particular political faction the right to define exactly what is meant by those terms to say, well, then you have to agree with all of these other extremely contentious positions or else you are a misogynist or else you are a racist, right? I say that, well, no, you know, don't I or, you know, don't people like me also get a say in the discussion about, you know, what is racism, about what is going to be the most effective to combat racism, right? And, you know, this cancellation mentality, I think, is spectacularly ineffective at its own professed gall of, you know, combating racism and sexism. What's a positive way out? So I, I try to, I don't know if you see what I do on Twitter, but I, on Twitter, I mostly, in my whole, in my life, I've actually, it's who I am to the core is like, I really focus on the positive and I try to put love out there in the world. And still, I get attacked. And I look at that and I wonder like, You too? I didn't know. Like, I haven't actually said anything difficult and nuanced. You talk about somebody like Steven Pinker, who I'm actually don't know the full range of things that he's attacked for, but he tries to say difficult. He tries to be thoughtful about difficult topics. He does. And obviously he just gets slaughtered by. Well, I mean, yes, but it's also amazing how well Steve has withstood it. I mean, he just survived that attempt to cancel him just a couple of months ago, right? Psychologically, he survives it too, which worries me because I don't think I can. Yeah, I've gotten to know Steve a bit. He is incredibly unperturbed by this stuff. And I admire that and I envy it. I wish that I could be like that. I mean, my impulse when I'm getting attacked is I just want to engage every single like anonymous person on Twitter and Reddit who is saying mean stuff about me. And I want to just say, well, look, can we just talk this over for an hour? And then you'll see that I'm not that bad. And sometimes that even works. The problem is then there's the 20,000 other ones. That's not, but psychologically, does that wear on you? It does. It does. But yeah, I mean, in terms of what is the solution, I mean, I wish I knew, right? And so in a certain way, these problems are maybe harder than P versus NP, right? I mean, but I think that part of it has to be that I think that there's a lot of sort of silent support for what I'll call the open discourse side, the reasonable enlightenment side. And I think that that support has to become less silent, right? I think that a lot of people just sort of agree that a lot of these cancellations and attacks are ridiculous, but are just afraid to say so, right? Or else they'll get shouted down as well, right? That's just the standard witch hunt dynamic, which, of course, this faction understands and exploits to its great advantage. But more people just said, we're not going to stand for this, right? This is, guess what? We're against racism too. But what you're doing is ridiculous, right? And the hard part is it takes a lot of mental energy. It takes a lot of time. Even if you feel like you're not going to be canceled or you're staying on the safe side, it takes a lot of time to phrase things in exactly the right way and to respond to everything people say. So, but I think that the more people speak up from all political persuasions, from all walks of life, then the easier it is to move forward. Since we've been talking about love, can you, last time I talked to you about meaning of life a little bit, but here has, it's a weird question to ask a computer scientist, but has love for other human beings, for things, for the world around you played an important role in your life? Have you, it's easy for a world class computer scientist, you could even call yourself like a physicist, everything to be lost in the books. Is the connection to other humans, love for other humans played an important role? I love my kids. I love my wife. I love my parents. I'm probably not different from most people in loving their families and in that being very important in my life. Now, I should remind you that I am a theoretical computer scientist. If you're looking for deep insight about the nature of love, you're probably looking in the wrong place to ask me, but sure, it's been important. But is there something from a computer science perspective to be said about love? Is that even beyond into the realm of consciousness? There was this great cartoon, I think it was one of the classic XKCDs where it shows a heart and it's squaring the heart, taking the four year transform of the heart, integrating the heart, each thing and then it says my normal approach is useless here. I'm so glad I asked this question. I think there's no better way to end this. I hope we get a chance to talk again. This has been an amazing, cool experiment to do it outside. I'm really glad you made it out. Yeah. Well, I appreciate it a lot. It's been a pleasure and I'm glad you were able to come out to Austin. Thanks.

And now let me leave you with some words from Scott Aaronson that I also gave to you in the introduction, which is, if you always win, then you're probably doing something wrong. Thank you for listening and for putting up with the intro and outro in this strange room in the middle of nowhere. And I very much hope to see you next time in many more ways than one. construct a system that had an enormous value of phi, like, you know, even larger than the brain has, but that is just implementing an error correcting code, you know, doing nothing that we would associate with, you know, intelligence or consciousness or any of it. The answer is yes, it is easy to do that. Right. And so I wrote blog posts, just making this point that, yeah, it's easy to do that. Now, you know, Tinoni's response to that was actually kind of incredible, right? I mean, I, I, I admired it in a way because instead of disputing any of it, he just bit the bullet in the sense, you know, he was one of the, the, uh, the most, uh, uh, audacious bullet bitings I've ever seen in my career. Okay. He said, okay, then fine. You know, this system that just applies this error correcting code it's conscious, you know, and if it has a much larger value of phi than you or me, it's much more conscious than you and me. You know, you, we just have to accept what the theory says because, you know, science is not about confirming our intuitions. It's about challenging them. And, you know, this is what my theory predicts that this thing is conscious and, you know, or super duper conscious. And how are you going to prove me wrong? So the way I would argue against your blog posts is I would say, yes, sure. You're right in general, but for naturally arising systems developed through the process of evolution on earth, the, this rule of the larger fee being associated, being associated with more consciousness is correct. Yeah. So that's not what he said at all. Right. Right. Because he wants this to be completely general. So we can apply to even computers. Yeah. I mean, I mean, the, the whole interest of the theory is the, you know, the hope that it could be completely general apply to aliens, to computers, to animals, coma patients, to any of it. Right. And so, so, so he just said, well, you know, Scott is relying on his intuition, but, you know, I'm relying on this theory and, you know, to me it was almost like, you know, are we being serious here? Like, like, like, you know, like, like, okay, yes, in science we try to learn highly nonintuitive things, but what we do is we first test the theory on cases where we already know the answer. Right. Like if we, if someone had a new theory of temperature, right, then, you know, maybe we could check that it says that boiling water is hotter than ice. And then if it says that the sun is hotter than anything, you know, you've ever experienced, then maybe we, we trust that extrapolation. Right. But like this, this theory, like if, if, you know, it's now saying that, you know, a, a gigantic grit, like regular grid of exclusive or gates can be way more conscious than, you know, a person or than, than any animal can be, you know, even if it, you know, is, you know, is, is, is, is so uniform that it might as well just be a blank wall. Right. And, and so now the point is if, if this theory is sort of getting wrong, the question is a blank wall, you know, more conscious than a person, then I would say, what is, what is there for it to get right? So your, your sense is a blank wall is not more conscious than a human being. Yeah. I mean, I mean, I mean, you could say that I am taking that as one of my axioms. I'm saying, I'm saying that if, if a theory of consciousness is, is getting that wrong, then whatever it is talking about at that point, I, I, I'm not going to call it consciousness. I'm going to use a different word. You have to use a different word. I mean, it's also, it's possible just like with intelligence that us humans conveniently define these very difficult to understand concepts in a very human centric way. Just like the Turing test really seems to define intelligence as a thing that's human like. Right. But I would say that with any, uh, concept, you know, there's, uh, uh, uh, you know, like we, we, we, we first need to define it. Right. And a definition is only a good definition if it matches what we thought we were talking about prior to having a definition. Right. And I would say that, you know, uh, fee as a definition of consciousness fails that test. That is my argument. So, okay. So let's take a further step. So you mentioned that the universe might be a Turing machine. So like it might be computations or simulatable by one anyway, simulated by one. So what's your sense about consciousness? Do you think consciousness is computation that we don't need to go to any place outside of the computable universe to, uh, you know, to, to understand consciousness, to build consciousness, to measure consciousness, all those kinds of things? I don't know. These are what, uh, you know, have been called the, the vertiginous questions, right? There's the questions like, like, uh, you know, you get a feeling of vertigo and thinking about them. Right. I mean, I certainly feel like, uh, I am conscious in a way that is not reducible to computation, but why should you believe me? Right. I mean, and, and, and if you said the same to me, then why should I believe you? But as computer scientists, I feel like a computer could be, could achieve human level intelligence, but, and that's actually a feeling and a hope. That's not a scientific belief. It's just, we've built up enough intuition, the same kind of intuition you use in your blog. You know, that's what scientists do. They, I mean, some of it is a scientific method, but some of it is just damn good intuition. I don't have a good intuition about consciousness. Yeah. I'm not sure that anyone does or has in the, you know, 2,500 years that these things have been discussed, Lex. But do you think we will? Like one of the, I've gotten a chance to attend, can't wait to hear your opinion on this, but attend the Neuralink event. And, uh, one of the dreams there is to, uh, you know, basically push neuroscience forward. And the hope with neuroscience is that, uh, we can inspect the machinery from which all this fun stuff emerges and see, we're going to notice something special, some special sauce from which something like consciousness or cognition emerges. Yeah. Well, it's clear that we've learned an enormous amount about neuroscience. We've learned an enormous amount about computation, you know, about machine learning, about AI, how to get it to work. We've learned, uh, an enormous amount about the underpinnings of the physical world, you know, and, you know, from one point of view, that's like, uh, an enormous distance that we've traveled along the road to understanding consciousness. From another point of view, you know, the distance still to be traveled on the road, you know, maybe seems no shorter than it was at the beginning. Right? So it's very hard to say. I mean, you know, these are questions like, like in, in, in sort of trying to have a theory of consciousness, there's sort of a problem where it feels like it's not just that we don't know how to make progress. It's that it's hard to specify what could even count as progress, right? Because no matter what scientific theory someone proposed, someone else could come along and say, well, you've just talked about the mechanism. You haven't said anything about what breathes fire into the mechanism, what really makes there something that it's like to be it. Right. And that seems like an objection that you could always raise no matter, you know, how much someone elucidated the details of how the brain works. Okay. Let's go to the Turing test and the Lobner Prize. I have this intuition, call me crazy, but we, that a machine to pass the Turing test and it's full, whatever the spirit of it is, we can talk about how to formulate the perfect Turing test, that that machine has to be conscious. We at least have to, I have a very low bar of what consciousness is. I tend to, I tend to think that the emulation of consciousness is as good as consciousness. So the consciousness is just a dance, a social, a social, a shortcut, like a nice, useful tool, but I tend to connect intelligence consciousness together. So by, by that, do you, maybe just to ask what, what role does consciousness play? Do you think it passed in the Turing test? Well, look, I mean, it's almost tautologically true that if we had a machine that passed the Turing test, then it would be emulating consciousness. Right? So if your position is that, you know, emulation of consciousness is consciousness, then so, you know, by, by definition, any machine that passed the Turing test would be conscious. But it's, but I mean, we know that you could say that, you know, that, that is just a way to rephrase the original question, you know, is an emulation of consciousness, you know, necessarily conscious. Right. And you can, can, you know, I hear, I'm not saying anything new that hasn't been debated ad nauseum in the literature. Okay. But, you know, you could imagine some very hard cases, like imagine a machine that passed the Turing test, but that did so just by an enormous cosmological sized lookup table that just cashed every possible conversation that could be had. The old Chinese room. Well, well, yeah, yeah. But, but this is, I mean, I mean, the Chinese room actually would be doing some computation, at least in Searle's version. Right. Here, I'm just talking about a table lookup. Okay. Now it's true that for conversations of a reasonable length, this, you know, lookup table would be so enormous that wouldn't even fit in the observable universe. Okay. But supposing that you could build a big enough lookup table and then just, you know, pass the Turing test just by looking up what the person said. Right. Are you going to regard that as conscious? Okay. Let me try to make this formal and then you can shut it down. I think that the emulation of something is that something, if there exists in that system, a black box that's full of mystery. So like, full of mystery to whom? To human specters. So does that mean that consciousness is relative to the observer? Like, could something be conscious for us, but not conscious for an alien that understood better what was happening inside the black box? Yes. So that if inside the black box is just a lookup table, the alien that saw that would say this is not conscious. To us, another way to phrase the black box is layers of abstraction, which make it very difficult to see to the actually underlying functionality of the system. And then we observe just the abstraction. And so it looks like magic to us. But once we understand the inner machinery, it stops being magic. And so like, that's a prerequisite is that you can't know how it works, or some part of it, because then there has to be in our human mind, entry point for the magic. So that's a formal definition of the system. Yeah, well, look, I mean, I explored a view in this essay I wrote called The Ghost in the Quantum Touring Machine seven years ago that is related to that, except that I did not want to have consciousness be relative to the observer, right? Because I think that if consciousness means anything, it is something that is experienced by the entity that is conscious, right? Like, I don't need you to tell me that I'm conscious, nor do you need me to tell you that you are, right? But basically, what I explored there is are there aspects of a system like a brain that just could not be predicted even with arbitrarily advanced future technologies? It's because of chaos combined with quantum mechanical uncertainty and things like that. I mean, that actually could be a property of the brain, you know, if true, that would distinguish it in a principled way, at least from any currently existing computer. Not from any possible computer, but yeah, yeah. This is a thought experiment. So if I gave you information that the entire history of your life, basically explain away free will with a lookup table, say that this was all predetermined, that everything you experienced has already been predetermined, wouldn't that take away your consciousness? Wouldn't you, yourself, wouldn't the experience of the world change for you in a way that you can't take back? Well, let me put it this way. If you could do like in a Greek tragedy where, you know, you would just write down a prediction for what I'm going to do and then maybe you put the prediction in a sealed box and maybe, you know, you open it later and you show that you knew everything I was going to do or, you know, of course, the even creepier version would be you tell me the prediction and then I try to falsify it, my very effort to falsify it makes it come true, right? Let's even forget that, you know, that version as convenient as it is for fiction writers, right? Let's just do the version where you put the prediction into a sealed envelope, okay? But if you could reliably predict everything that I was going to do, I'm not sure that that would destroy my sense of being conscious, but I think it really would destroy my sense of having free will, you know, and much, much more than any philosophical conversation could possibly do that, right? And so I think it becomes extremely interesting to ask, you know, could such predictions be done, you know, even in principle, is it consistent with the laws of physics to make such predictions, to get enough data about someone that you could actually generate such predictions without having to kill them in the process to, you know, slice their brain up into little slivers or something. I mean, it's theoretically possible, right? Well, I don't know. I mean, it might be possible, but only at the cost of destroying the person, right? I mean, it depends on how low you have to go in sort of the substrate. Like if there was a nice digital abstraction layer, if you could think of each neuron as a kind of transistor computing a digital function, then you could imagine some nanorobots that would go in and would just scan the state of each transistor, you know, of each neuron and then, you know, make a good enough copy, right? But if it was actually important to get down to the molecular or the atomic level, then, you know, eventually you would be up against quantum effects. You would be up against the unclonability of quantum states. So I think it's a question of how good of a replica, how good does the replica have to be before you're going to count it as actually a copy of you or as being able to predict your actions. That's a totally open question. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And especially once we say that, well, look, maybe there's no way to, you know, to make a deterministic prediction because, you know, we know that there's noise buffeting the brain around, presumably even quantum mechanical uncertainty, you know, affecting the sodium ion channels, for example, whether they open or they close. You know, there's no reason why over a certain time scale that shouldn't be amplified, just like we imagine happens with the weather or with any other, you know, chaotic system. So if that stuff is important, right, then we would say, well, you know, you can't, you know, you're never going to be able to make an accurate enough copy. But now the hard part is, well, what if someone can make a copy that sort of no one else can tell apart from you, right? It says the same kinds of things that you would have said, maybe not exactly the same things because we agree that there's noise, but it says the same kinds of things. And maybe you alone would say, no, I know that that's not me, you know, it's, it doesn't share my, I haven't felt my consciousness leap over to that other thing. I still feel it localized in this version, right? And then why should anyone else believe you? What are your thoughts? I'd be curious, you're a really good person to ask, which is Penrose's, Roger Penrose's work on consciousness, saying that there, you know, there is some, there's some, with axons and so on, there might be some biological places where quantum mechanics can come into play and through that create consciousness somehow. Yeah. Okay. Well, um, uh, of course, you know, I read Penrose's books as a teenager. They had a huge impact on me. Uh, uh, five or six years ago, I had the privilege to actually talk these things over with Penrose, you know, at some length at a conference in Minnesota. And, uh, you know, he is, uh, uh, you know, an amazing, uh, personality. I admire the fact that he was even raising such, uh, audacious questions at all. Uh, but you know, to, to, to answer your question, I think the first thing we need to get clear on is that he is not merely saying that quantum mechanics is relevant to consciousness, right? That would be like, um, you know, that would be tame compared to what he is saying, right? He is saying that, you know, even quantum mechanics is not good enough, right? If, because if, if supposing for example, that the brain were a quantum computer, I know that's still a computer, you know, in fact, a quantum computer can be simulated by an ordinary computer. It might merely need exponentially more time in order to do so, right? So that's simply not good enough for him. Okay. So what he wants is for the brain to be a quantum gravitational computer or, or, uh, uh, he wants the brain to be exploiting as yet unknown laws of quantum gravity. Okay. Which would, which would be uncomputable. That's the key point. Okay. Yes. Yes. That would be literally uncomputable. And I've asked him, you know, to clarify this, but uncomputable, even if you had an Oracle for the halting problem or, you know, and, and, or, you know, as high up as you want to go and the sort of high, the usual hierarchy of uncomputability, he wants to go beyond all of that. Okay. So, so, you know, just, just to be clear, like, you know, if we're keeping count of how many speculations, you know, there's probably like at least five or six of them, right? There's first of all, that there is some quantum gravity theory that would involve this kind of uncomputability, right? Most people who study quantum gravity would not agree with that. They would say that what we've learned, you know, what little we know about quantum gravity from the, this ADS CFT correspondence, for example, has been very much consistent with the broad idea of nature being computable, right? But, but all right, but, but supposing that he's right about that, then, you know, what most physicists would say is that whatever new phenomena there are in quantum gravity, you know, they might be relevant at the singularities of black holes. They might be relevant at the big bang. They are plainly not relevant to something like the brain, you know, that is operating at ordinary temperatures, you know, with ordinary chemistry and, you know, the, the, the physics underlying the brain, they, they would say that we have, you know, the fundamental physics of the brain, they would say that we've pretty much completely known for, for generations now, right? Because, you know, quantum field theory lets us sort of parameterize our ignorance, right? I mean, Sean Carroll has made this case and, you know, in great detail, right? That sort of whatever new effects are coming from quantum gravity, you know, they are sort of screened off by quantum field theory, right? And this is, this brings, you know, brings us to the whole idea of effective theories, right? But the, like we have, you know, the, in like in the standard model of elementary particles, right? We have a quantum field theory that seems totally adequate for all of the terrestrial phenomena, right? The only things that it doesn't, you know, explain are, well, first of all, you know, the details of gravity, if you were to probe it, like at, at, you know, extremes of, you know, curvature or like incredibly small distances, it doesn't explain dark matter. It doesn't explain black hole singularities, right? But these are all very exotic things, very, you know, far removed from our life on earth, right? So for Penrose to be right, he needs, you know, these phenomena to somehow affect the brain. He needs the brain to contain antennae that are sensitive to this as yet unknown physics, right? And then he needs a modification of quantum mechanics, okay? So he needs quantum mechanics to actually be wrong, okay? He needs, what he wants is what he calls an objective reduction mechanism or an objective collapse. So this is the idea that once quantum states get large enough, then they somehow spontaneously collapse, right? That, you know, and this is an idea that lots of people have explored. You know, there's something called the GRW proposal that tries to, you know, say something along those lines, you know, and these are theories that actually make testable predictions, right? Which is a nice feature that they have. But, you know, the very fact that they're testable may mean that in the, you know, in the coming decades, we may well be able to test these theories and show that they're wrong, right? You know, we may be able to test some of Penrose's ideas. If not, not his ideas about consciousness, but at least his ideas about an objective collapse of quantum states, right? And people have actually, like Dick Balmeister, have actually been working to try to do these experiments. They haven't been able to do it yet to test Penrose's proposal, okay? But Penrose would need more than just an objective collapse of quantum states, which would already be the biggest development in physics for a century since quantum mechanics itself, okay? He would need for consciousness to somehow be able to influence the direction of the collapse so that it wouldn't be completely random, but that, you know, your dispositions would somehow influence the quantum state to collapse more likely this way or that way, okay? Finally, Penrose, you know, says that all of this has to be true because of an argument that he makes based on G\\u00f6del's incompleteness theorem, okay? Now, like I would say the overwhelming majority of computer scientists and mathematicians who have thought about this, I don't think that G\\u00f6del's incompleteness theorem can do what he needs it to do here, right? I don't think that that argument is sound, okay? But that is, you know, that is sort of the tower that you have to ascend to if you're going to go where Penrose goes. And the intuition he uses with the incompleteness theorem is that basically that there's important stuff that's not computable? Is that where he takes it? It's not just that because, I mean, everyone agrees that there are problems that are uncomputable, right? That's a mathematical theorem, right? But what Penrose wants to say is that, you know, for example, there are statements, you know, given any formal system, you know, for doing math, right? There will be true statements of arithmetic that that formal system, you know, if it's adequate for math at all, if it's consistent and so on, will not be able to prove. A famous example being the statement that that system itself is consistent, right? No, you know, good formal system can actually prove its own consistency. That can only be done from a stronger formal system, which then can't prove its own consistency and so on forever, okay? That's G\\u00f6del's theorem. But now, why is that relevant to consciousness, right? Well, you know, I mean, the idea that it might have something to do with consciousness as an old one, G\\u00f6del himself apparently thought that it did. You know, Lucas thought so, I think, in the 60s. And Penrose is really just, you know, sort of updating what they and others had said. I mean, you know, the idea that G\\u00f6del's theorem could have something to do with consciousness was, you know, in 1950, when Alan Turing wrote his article about the Turing test, he already, you know, was writing about that as like an old and well known idea and as a wrong one that he wanted to dispense with. Okay, but the basic problem with this idea is, you know, Penrose wants to say that and all of his predecessors here, you know, want to say that, you know, even though, you know, this given formal system cannot prove its own consistency, we as humans sort of looking at it from the outside can just somehow see its consistency, right? And the, you know, the rejoinder to that, you know, from the very beginning has been, well, can we really? I mean, maybe, you know, maybe he, Penrose can, but, you know, can the rest of us, right? And, you know, I noticed that, you know, I mean, it is perfectly plausible to imagine a computer that could say, you know, it would not be limited to working within a single formal system, right? They could say, I am now going to adopt the hypothesis that my formal system is consistent, right? And I'm now going to see what can be done from that stronger vantage point and so on. And, you know, and I'm going to add new axioms to my system. Totally plausible. There's absolutely, G\\u00f6del's theorem has nothing to say about against an AI that could repeatedly add new axioms. All it says is that there is no absolute guarantee that when the AI adds new axioms that it will always be right. Okay. And, you know, and that's, of course, the point that Penrose pounces on, but the reply is obvious. And, you know, it's one that Alan Turing made 70 years ago. Namely, we don't have an absolute guarantee that we're right when we add a new axiom. We never have, and plausibly we never will. So on Alan Turing, you took part in the Lubna Prize? Not really. No, I didn't. I mean, there was this kind of ridiculous claim that was made some almost a decade ago about a chat bot called Eugene Goostman. I guess you didn't participate as a judge in the Lubna Prize. I didn't. But you participated as a judge in that, I guess it was an exhibition event or something like that, or with Eugene... Eugene Goostman, that was just me writing a blog post because some journalist called me to ask about it. Did you ever chat with him? I thought that... I did chat with Eugene Goostman. I mean, it was available on the web. Oh, interesting. I didn't know that. So yeah. So all that happened was that a bunch of journalists started writing breathless articles about a first chat bot that passes the Turing test. And it was this thing called Eugene Goostman that was supposed to simulate a 13 year old boy. And apparently someone had done some test where people were less than perfect, let's say, distinguishing it from a human. And they said, well, if you look at Turing's paper and you look at the percentages that he talked about, then it seemed like we're past that threshold. And I had a different way to look at it instead of the legalistic way, like let's just try the actual thing out and let's see what it can do with questions like, is Mount Everest bigger than a shoebox? Or just like the most obvious questions. And the answer is, well, it just kind of parries you because it doesn't know what you're talking about. So just to clarify exactly in which way they're obvious. They're obvious in the sense that you convert the sentences into the meaning of the objects they represent and then do some basic obvious common sense reasoning with the objects that the sentences represent. Right. It was not able to answer or even intelligently respond to basic common sense questions. But let me say something stronger than that. There was a famous chatbot in the 60s called Eliza that managed to actually fool a lot of people. Or people would pour their hearts out into this Eliza because it simulated a therapist. And most of what it would do is it would just throw back at you whatever you said. And this turned out to be incredibly effective. Maybe therapists know this. This is one of their tricks. But it really had some people convinced. But this thing was just like, I think it was literally just a few hundred lines of Lisp code. It was not only was it not intelligent, it wasn't especially sophisticated. It was like a simple little hobbyist program. And Eugene Goostman, from what I could see, was not a significant advance compared to Eliza. And that was really the point I was making. In some sense, you didn't need a computer science professor to sort of say this. Anyone who was looking at it and who just had an ounce of sense could have said the same thing. But because these journalists were calling me, the first thing I said was, well, I'm a quantum computing person. I'm not an AI person. You shouldn't ask me. Then they said, look, you can go here and you can try it out. I said, all right. All right. So I'll try it out. This whole discussion, it got a whole lot more interesting in just the last few months. Yeah. I'd love to hear your thoughts about GPT3. In the last few months, the world has now seen a chat engine or a text engine, I should say, called GPT3. I think it still does not pass a Turing test. There are no real claims that it passes the Turing test. This comes out of the group at OpenAI, and they've been relatively careful in what they've claimed about the system. But I think as clearly as Eugene Goostman was not in advance over Eliza, it is equally clear that this is a major advance over Eliza or really over anything that the world has seen before. This is a text engine that can come up with kind of on topic, reasonable sounding completions to just about anything that you ask. You can ask it to write a poem about topic X in the style of poet Y and it will have a go at that. And it will do not a great job, not an amazing job, but a passable job. Definitely as good as, in many cases, I would say better than I would have done. You can ask it to write an essay, like a student essay, about pretty much any topic and it will get something that I am pretty sure would get at least a B minus in the most high school or even college classes. And in some sense, the way that it did this, the way that it achieves this, Scott Alexander of the much mourned blog, Slate Star Codex, had a wonderful way of putting it. He said that they basically just ground up the entire internet into a slurry. And to tell you the truth, I had wondered for a while why nobody had tried that. Why not write a chat bot by just doing deep learning over a corpus consisting of the entire web? And so now they finally have done that. And the results are very impressive. It's not clear that people can argue about whether this is truly a step toward general AI or not, but this is an amazing capability that we didn't have a few years ago. A few years ago, if you had told me that we would have it now, that would have surprised me. And I think that anyone who denies that is just not engaging with what's there. So their model, it takes a large part of the internet and compresses it in a small number of parameters relative to the size of the internet and is able to, without fine tuning, do a basic kind of a querying mechanism, just like you described where you specify a kind of poet and then you want to write a poem. And it somehow is able to do basically a lookup on the internet of relevant things. How else do you explain it? Well, okay. The training involved massive amounts of data from the internet and actually took lots and lots of computer power, lots of electricity. There are some very prosaic reasons why this wasn't done earlier. But it costs some tens of millions of dollars, I think. Less, but approximately like a few million dollars. Oh, okay. Oh, really? Okay. It's more like four or five. Oh, all right. All right. Thank you. I mean, as they scale it up, it will... It'll cost, but then the hope is cost comes down and all that kind of stuff. But basically, it is a neural net or what's now called a deep net, but they're basically the same thing. So it's a form of algorithm that people have known about for decades. But it is constantly trying to solve the problem, predict the next word. So it's just trying to predict what comes next. It's not trying to decide what it should say, what ought to be true. It's trying to predict what someone who had said all of the words up to the preceding one would say next. Although to push back on that, that's how it's trained. That's right. No, of course. It's arguable that our very cognition could be a mechanism as that simple. Oh, of course. Of course. I never said that it wasn't. Right. But... Yeah. I mean, and sometimes that is... If there is a deep philosophical question that's raised by GPT3, then that is it, right? Are we doing anything other than this predictive processing, just trying to constantly trying to fill in a blank of what would come next after what we just said up to this point? Is that what I'm doing right now? It's impossible. So the intuition that a lot of people have, well, look, this thing is not going to be able to reason, the Mountain Everest question. Do you think it's possible that GPT5, 6, and 7 would be able to, with this exact same process, begin to do something that looks like... Is indistinguishable to us humans from reasoning? I mean, the truth is that we don't really know what the limits are, right? Right. Exactly. Because what we've seen so far is that GPT3 was basically the same thing as GPT2, but just with a much larger network, more training time, bigger training corpus, right? And it was very noticeably better than its immediate predecessor. So we don't know where you hit the ceiling here, right? I mean, that's the amazing part and maybe also the scary part, right? Now, my guess would be that at some point, there has to be diminishing returns. It can't be that simple, can it? Right? But I wish that I had more to base that guess on. Right. Yeah. I mean, some people say that there will be a limitation on the... We're going to hit a limit on the amount of data that's on the internet. Yes. Yeah. So sure. So there's certainly that limit. I mean, there's also... If you are looking for questions that will stump GPT3, you can come up with some without... Even getting it to learn how to balance parentheses, right? It doesn't do such a great job, right? And its failures are ironic, right? Like basic arithmetic, right? And you think, isn't that what computers are supposed to be best at? Isn't that where computers already had us beat a century ago? Right? And yet that's where GPT3 struggles, right? But it's amazing that it's almost like a young child in that way, right? But somehow, because it is just trying to predict what comes next, it doesn't know when it should stop doing that and start doing something very different, like some more exact logical reasoning, right? And so one is naturally led to guess that our brain sort of has some element of predictive processing, but that it's coupled to other mechanisms, right? That it's coupled to, first of all, visual reasoning, which GPT3 also doesn't have any of, right? Although there's some demonstration that there's a lot of promise there using... Oh yeah, it can complete images. That's right. And using exact same kind of transformer mechanisms to like watch videos on YouTube. And so the same self supervised mechanism to be able to look, it'd be fascinating to think what kind of completions you could do. Oh yeah, no, absolutely. Although like if we ask it to like, you know, a word problem that involve reasoning about the locations of things in space, I don't think it does such a great job on those, right? To take an example. And so the guess would be, well, you know, humans have a lot of predictive processing, a lot of just filling in the blanks, but we also have these other mechanisms that we can couple to, or that we can sort of call as subroutines when we need to. And that maybe, you know, to go further, that one would want to integrate other forms of reasoning. Let me go on another topic that is amazing, which is complexity. And then start with the most absurdly romantic question of what's the most beautiful idea in computer science or theoretical computer science to you? Like what just early on in your life, or in general, have captivated you and just grabbed you? I think I'm going to have to go with the idea of universality. You know, if you're really asking for the most beautiful. I mean, so universality is the idea that, you know, you put together a few simple operations, like in the case of Boolean logic, that might be the AND gate, the OR gate, the NOT gate, right? And then your first guess is, okay, this is a good start, but obviously, as I want to do more complicated things, I'm going to need more complicated building blocks to express that, right? And that was actually my guess when I first learned what programming was. I mean, when I was, you know, an adolescent and someone showed me Apple basic, and then, you know, GW basic, if anyone listening remembers that. Okay. But, you know, I thought, okay, well, now, you know, I mean, I thought I felt like this is a revelation. You know,\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"summary\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 255,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"n being, understanding their unique strengths and weaknesses, and helping them achieve their full potential in the field of computer science.

That's all I have to say about that.\",\n          \"and then at the end it's like, \\\"Ah, now I see you've ruined it.\\\" So, I mean, I think that love is one of the most fascinating things to try to understand from a scientific perspective. I mean, it's fascinating because it's a subjective experience. It's deeply tied to our emotions, our thoughts, our behaviors. It's very personal and individual, but it's also universal. It's something that everyone experiences in some form or another. So, I think there's a lot to explore about the science of love and how it intersects with our understanding of consciousness, emotions, and social interactions. So, yeah, I mean, I think there's a lot to ponder and discover about the mysteries of love, even from a computer science perspective. But again, it's a complex and multi-dimensional topic that goes beyond the realms of algorithms and complexity classes. But I think it's a topic worth delving into with an open mind and a curious spirit.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

In 1985, he received the Turing Award for his research in the theory of algorithms, including the development of the Admirons Karp algorithm for solving the max flow problem on networks, Hopcroft Karp algorithm for finding maximum cardinality matchings in bipartite graphs, and his landmark paper in complexity theory called Reduceability Among Combinatorial Problems, in which he proved 21 problems to be NP complete. This paper was probably the most important catalyst in the explosion of interest in the study of NP completeness and the P versus NP problem in general. Quick summary of the ads. Two sponsors, 8sleep mattress and Cash App. Please consider supporting this podcast by going to 8sleep.com slash Lex and downloading Cash App and using code LexPodcast. Click the links, buy the stuff. It really is the best way to support this podcast. If you enjoy this thing, subscribe on YouTube, review it with five stars on Apple Podcast, support it on Patreon, or connect with me on Twitter at Lex Friedman. As usual, I'll do a few minutes of ads now and never any ads in the middle that can break the flow of the conversation. This show is sponsored by 8sleep and its Pod Pro mattress that you can check out at 8sleep.com slash Lex to get $200 off. It controls temperature with an app. It can cool down to as low as 55 degrees on each side of the bed separately. Research shows that temperature has a big impact on the quality of our sleep. Anecdotally, it's been a game changer for me. I love it. It's been a couple of weeks now. I've just been really enjoying it, both in the fact that I'm getting better sleep and that it's a smart mattress, essentially. I kind of imagine this being the early days of artificial intelligence being a part of every aspect of our lives. And certainly infusing AI in one of the most important aspects of life, which is sleep, I think has a lot of potential for being beneficial. The Pod Pro is packed with sensors that track heart rate, heart rate variability, and respiratory rate, showing it all in their app. The app's health metrics are amazing, but the cooling alone is honestly worth the money. I don't always sleep, but when I do, I choose the 8th Sleep Pod Pro mattress. Check it out at 8thSleep.com slash Lex to get $200 off. And remember, just visiting the site and considering the purchase helps convince the folks at 8th Sleep that this silly old podcast is worth sponsoring in the future. This show is also presented by the great and powerful Cash App, the number one finance app in the App Store. When you get it, use code LEXPODCAST. Cash App lets you send money to friends, buy Bitcoin, and invest in the stock market with as little as $1. It's one of the best designed interfaces of an app that I've ever used. To me, good design is when everything is easy and natural. Bad design is when the app gets in the way, either because it's buggy, or because it tries too hard to be helpful. I'm looking at you, Clippy, from Microsoft, even though I love you. Anyway, there's a big part of my brain and heart that loves to design things and also to appreciate great design by others. So again, if you get Cash App from the App Store or Google Play and use the code LEXPODCAST, you get $10, and Cash App will also donate $10 to FIRST, an organization that is helping to advance robotics and STEM education for young people around the world. And now, here's my conversation with Richard Karp. You wrote that at the age of 13, you were first exposed to plane geometry and was wonderstruck by the power and elegance of form of proofs. Are there problems, proofs, properties, ideas in plane geometry that from that time that you remember being mesmerized by or just enjoying to go through to prove various aspects? So Michael Rabin told me this story about an experience he had when he was a young student who was tossed out of his classroom for bad behavior and was wandering through the corridors of his school and came upon two older students who were studying the problem of finding the shortest distance between two nonoverlapping circles. And Michael thought about it and said, you take the straight line between the two centers and the segment between the two circles is the shortest because a straight line is the shortest distance between the two centers. And any other line connecting the circles would be on a longer line. And I thought, and he thought, and I agreed that this was just elegance, the pure reasoning could come up with such a result. Certainly the shortest distance from the two centers of the circles is a straight line. Could you once again say what's the next step in that proof? Well, any segment joining the two circles, if you extend it by taking the radius on each side, you get a path with three edges which connects the two centers. And this has to be at least as long as the shortest path, which is the straight line. The straight line, yeah. Wow, yeah, that's quite simple. So what is it about that elegance that you just find compelling? Well, just that you could establish a fact about geometry beyond dispute by pure reasoning. I also enjoy the challenge of solving puzzles in plain geometry. It was much more fun than the earlier mathematics courses which were mostly about arithmetic operations and manipulating them. Was there something about geometry itself, the slightly visual component of it? Oh, yes, absolutely, although I lacked three dimensional vision. I wasn't very good at three dimensional vision. You mean being able to visualize three dimensional objects? Three dimensional objects or surfaces, hyperplanes and so on. So there I didn't have an intuition. But for example, the fact that the sum of the angles of a triangle is 180 degrees is proved convincingly. And it comes as a surprise that that can be done. Why is that surprising? Well, it is a surprising idea, I suppose. Why is that proved difficult? It's not, that's the point. It's so easy and yet it's so convincing. Do you remember what is the proof that it adds up to 180? You start at a corner and draw a line parallel to the opposite side. And that line sort of trisects the angle between the other two sides. And you get a half plane which has to add up to 180 degrees. It has to add up to 180 degrees and it consists in the angles by the equality of alternate angles. What's it called? You get a correspondence between the angles created along the side of the triangle and the three angles of the triangle. Has geometry had an impact on when you look into the future of your work with combinatorial algorithms? Has it had some kind of impact in terms of, yeah, being able, the puzzles, the visual aspects that were first so compelling to you? Not Euclidean geometry particularly. I think I use tools like linear programming and integer programming a lot. But those require high dimensional visualization and so I tend to go by the algebraic properties. Right, you go by the linear algebra and not by the visualization. Well, the interpretation in terms of, for example, finding the highest point on a polyhedron as in linear programming is motivating. But again, I don't have the high dimensional intuition that would particularly inform me so I sort of lean on the algebra. So to linger on that point, what kind of visualization do you do when you're trying to think about, we'll get to combinatorial algorithms, but just algorithms in general. Yeah. What's inside your mind when you're thinking about designing algorithms? Or even just tackling any mathematical problem? Well, I think that usually an algorithm involves a repetition of some inner loop and so I can sort of visualize the distance from the desired solution as iteratively reducing until you finally hit the exact solution. And try to take steps that get you closer to the. Try to take steps that get closer and having the certainty of converging. So it's basically the mechanics of the algorithm is often very simple, but especially when you're trying something out on the computer. So for example, I did some work on the traveling salesman problem and I could see there was a particular function that had to be minimized and it was fascinating to see the successive approaches to the minimum, to the optimum. You mean, so first of all, traveling salesman problem is where you have to visit every city without ever, the only ones. Yeah, that's right. Find the shortest path through a set of cities. Yeah, which is sort of a canonical standard, a really nice problem that's really hard. Right, exactly, yes. So can you say again what was nice about being able to think about the objective function there and maximizing it or minimizing it? Well, just that as the algorithm proceeded, you were making progress, continual progress, and eventually getting to the optimum point. So there's two parts, maybe. Maybe you can correct me. First is like getting an intuition about what the solution would look like and or even maybe coming up with a solution and two is proving that this thing is actually going to be pretty good. What part is harder for you? Where's the magic happen? Is it in the first sets of intuitions or is it in the messy details of actually showing that it is going to get to the exact solution and it's gonna run at a certain complexity? Well, the magic is just the fact that the gap from the optimum decreases monotonically and you can see it happening and various metrics of what's going on are improving all along until finally you hit the optimum. Perhaps later we'll talk about the assignment problem and I can illustrate. It illustrates a little better. Now zooming out again, as you write, Don Knuth has called attention to a breed of people who derive great aesthetic pleasure from contemplating the structure of computational processes. So Don calls these folks geeks and you write that you remember the moment you realized you were such a person, you were shown the Hungarian algorithm to solve the assignment problem. So perhaps you can explain what the assignment problem is and what the Hungarian algorithm is. So in the assignment problem, you have n boys and n girls and you are given the desirability of, or the cost of matching the ith boy with the jth girl for all i and j. You're given a matrix of numbers and you want to find the one to one matching of the boys with the girls such that the sum of the associated costs will be minimized. So the best way to match the boys with the girls or men with jobs or any two sets. Any possible matching is possible or? Yeah, all one to one correspondences are permissible. If there is a connection that is not allowed, then you can think of it as having an infinite cost. I see, yeah. So what you do is to depend on the observation that the identity of the optimal assignment or as we call it, the optimal permutation is not changed if you subtract a constant from any row or column of the matrix. You can see that the comparison between the different assignments is not changed by that. Because if you decrease a particular row, all the elements of a row by some constant, all solutions decrease by an amount equal to that constant. So the idea of the algorithm is to start with a matrix of non negative numbers and keep subtracting from rows or from columns. Subtracting from rows or entire columns in such a way that you subtract the same constant from all the elements of that row or column while maintaining the property that all the elements are non negative. Simple. Yeah, and so what you have to do is find small moves which will decrease the total cost while subtracting constants from rows or columns. And there's a particular way of doing that by computing the kind of shortest path through the elements in the matrix. And you just keep going in this way until you finally get a full permutation of zeros while the matrix is non negative and then you know that that has to be the cheapest. Is that as simple as it sounds? So the shortest path of the matrix part. Yeah, the simplicity lies in how you find, I oversimplified slightly what you, you will end up subtracting a constant from some rows or columns and adding the same constant back to other rows and columns. So as not to reduce any of the zero elements, you leave them unchanged. But each individual step modifies several rows and columns by the same amount but overall decreases the cost. So there's something about that elegance that made you go aha, this is a beautiful, like it's amazing that something like this, something so simple can solve a problem like this. Yeah, it's really cool. If I had mechanical ability, I would probably like to do woodworking or other activities where you sort of shape something into something beautiful and orderly and there's something about the orderly systematic nature of that iterative algorithm that is pleasing to me. So what do you think about this idea of geeks as Don Knuth calls them? What do you think, is it something specific to a mindset that allows you to discover the elegance in computational processes or is this all of us, can all of us discover this beauty? Were you born this way? I think so. I always like to play with numbers. I used to amuse myself by multiplying by multiplying four digit decimal numbers in my head and putting myself to sleep by starting with one and doubling the number as long as I could go and testing my memory, my ability to retain the information. And I also read somewhere that you wrote that you enjoyed showing off to your friends by I believe multiplying four digit numbers. Right. Four digit numbers. Yeah, I had a summer job at a beach resort outside of Boston and the other employee, I was the barker at a skee ball game. Yeah. I used to sit at a microphone saying come one, come all, come in and play skee ball, five cents to play, a nickel to win and so on. That's what a barker, I wasn't sure if I should know but barker, that's, so you're the charming, outgoing person that's getting people to come in. Yeah, well I wasn't particularly charming but I could be very repetitious and loud. And the other employees were sort of juvenile delinquents who had no academic bent but somehow I found that I could impress them by performing to the P equals NP question because all it takes is to show that one algorithm in this class. So the P versus NP can be re expressed as simply asking whether the satisfiability problem of propositional logic is solvable in polynomial time. But there's more. I encountered Cook's paper when he published it in a conference in 1971. Yeah, so when I saw Cook's paper and saw this reduction of each of the problems in NP by a uniform method to the satisfiability problem of propositional logic, that meant that the satisfiability problem was a universal combinatorial problem. And it occurred to me through experience I had had in trying to solve other combinatorial problems that there were many other problems which seemed to have that universal structure. And so I began looking for reductions from the satisfiability to other problems. And one of the other problems would be the so called integer programming problem of determining whether there's a solution to a set of linear inequalities involving integer variables. Just like linear programming, but there's a constraint that the variables must remain integers. In fact, must be the zero or one could only take on those values. And that makes the problem much harder. Yes, that makes the problem much harder. And it was not difficult to show that the satisfiability problem can be restated as an integer programming problem. So can you pause on that? Was that one of the first mappings that you tried to do? And how hard is that mapping? You said it wasn't hard to show, but that's a big leap. It is a big leap, yeah. Well, let me give you another example. Another problem in NP is whether a graph contains a clique of a given size. And now the question is, can we reduce the propositional logic problem to the problem of whether there's a clique of a certain size? Well, if you look at the propositional logic problem, it can be expressed as a number of clauses, each of which is a, of the form A or B or C, where A is either one of the variables in the problem or the negation of one of the variables. And an instance of the propositional logic problem can be rewritten using operations of Boolean logic, can be rewritten as the conjunction of a set of clauses, the AND of a set of ORs, where each clause is a disjunction, an OR of variables or negated variables. So the question in the satisfiability problem is whether those clauses can be simultaneously satisfied. Now, to satisfy all those clauses, you have to find one of the terms in each clause, which is going to be true in your truth assignment, but you can't make the same variable both true and false. So if you have the variable A in one clause and you want to satisfy that clause by making A true, you can't also make the complement of A true in some other clause. And so the goal is to make every single clause true if it's possible to satisfy this, and the way you make it true is at least... One term in the clause must be true. Got it. So now we, to convert this problem to something called the independent set problem, where you're just sort of asking for a set of vertices in a graph such that no two of them are adjacent, sort of the opposite of the clique problem. So we've seen that we can now express that as finding a set of terms, one in each clause, without picking both the variable and the negation of that variable, because if the variable is assigned the truth value, the negated variable has to have the opposite truth value. And so we can construct a graph where the vertices are the terms in all of the clauses, and you have an edge between two terms if an edge between two occurrences of terms, either if they're both in the same clause, because you're only picking one element from each clause, and also an edge between them if they represent opposite values of the same variable, because you can't make a variable both true and false. And so you get a graph where you have all of these occurrences of variables, you have edges, which mean that you're not allowed to choose both ends of the edge, either because they're in the same clause or they're negations of one another. All right, and that's a, first of all, sort of to zoom out, that's a really powerful idea that you can take a graph and connect it to a logic equation somehow, and do that mapping for all possible formulations of a particular problem on a graph. Yeah. I mean, that still is hard for me to believe. Yeah, it's hard for me to believe. It's hard for me to believe that that's possible. That they're, like, what do you make of that, that there's such a union of, there's such a friendship among all these problems across that somehow are akin to combinatorial algorithms, that they're all somehow related? I know it can be proven, but what do you make of it, that that's true? Well, that they just have the same expressive power. You can take any one of them and translate it into the terms of the other. The fact that they have the same expressive power also somehow means that they can be translatable. Right, and what I did in the 1971 paper was to take 21 fundamental problems, the commonly occurring problems of packing, covering, matching, and so forth, lying in the class NP, and show that the satisfiability problem can be reexpressed as any of those, that any of those have the same expressive power. And that was like throwing down the gauntlet of saying there's probably many more problems like this. Right. Saying that, look, that they're all the same. They're all the same, but not exactly. They're all the same in terms of whether they are rich enough to express any of the others. But that doesn't mean that they have the same computational complexity. But what we can say is that either all of these problems or none of them are solvable in polynomial time. Yeah, so what is NP completeness and NP hard as classes? Oh, that's just a small technicality. So when we're talking about decision problems, that means that the answer is just yes or no. There is a clique of size 15 or there's not a clique of size 15. On the other hand, an optimization problem would be asking find the largest clique. The answer would not be yes or no. It would be 15. So when you're asking for the, when you're putting a valuation on the different solutions and you're asking for the one with the highest valuation, that's an optimization problem. And there's a very close affinity between the two kinds of problems. But the counterpart of being the hardest decision problem, the hardest yes, no problem, the counterpart of that is to minimize or maximize an objective function. And so a problem that's hardest in the class when viewed in terms of optimization, those are called NP hard rather than NP complete. And NP complete is for decision problems. And NP complete is for decision problems. So if somebody shows that P equals NP, what do you think that proof will look like if you were to put on yourself, if it's possible to show that as a proof or to demonstrate an algorithm? All I can say is that it will involve concepts that we do not now have and approaches that we don't have. Do you think those concepts are out there in terms of inside complexity theory, inside of computational analysis of algorithms? Do you think there's concepts that are totally outside of the box that we haven't considered yet? I think that if there is a proof that P is equal to NP or that P is unequal to NP, it'll depend on concepts that are now outside the box. Now, if that's shown either way, P equals NP or P not, well, actually P equals NP, what impact, you kind of mentioned a little bit, but can you linger on it? What kind of impact would it have on theoretical computer science and perhaps software based systems in general? Well, I think it would have enormous impact on the world in either way case. If P is unequal to NP, which is what we expect, then we know that for the great majority of the combinatorial problems that come up, since they're known to be NP complete, we're not going to be able to solve them by efficient algorithms. However, there's a little bit of hope in that it may be that we can solve most instances. All we know is that if a problem is not NP, then it can't be solved efficiently on all instances. But basically, if we find that P is unequal to NP, it will mean that we can't expect always to get the optimal solutions to these problems. And we have to depend on heuristics that perhaps work most of the time or give us good approximate solutions, but not. So we would turn our eye towards the heuristics with a little bit more acceptance and comfort on our hearts. Exactly. Okay, so let me ask a romanticized question. What to you is one of the most or the most beautiful combinatorial algorithm in your own life or just in general in the field that you've ever come across or have developed yourself? Oh, I like the stable matching problem or the stable marriage problem very much. What's the stable matching problem? Yeah. Imagine that you want to marry off N boys with N girls. And each boy has an ordered list of his preferences among the girls. His first choice, his second choice, through her, Nth choice. And each girl also has an ordering of the boys, his first choice, second choice, and so on. And we'll say that a matching, a one to one matching of the boys with the girls is stable if there are no two couples in the matching such that the boy in the first couple prefers the girl in the second couple to her mate and she prefers the boy to her current mate. In other words, if the matching is stable if there is no pair who want to run away with each other leaving their partners behind. Gosh, yeah. Yeah. Actually, this is relevant to matching residents with hospitals and some other real life problems, although not quite in the form that I described. So it turns out that there is, for any set of preferences, a stable matching exists. And moreover, it can be computed by a simple algorithm in which each boy starts making proposals to girls. And if the girl receives the proposal, she accepts it tentatively, but she can drop it later if she gets a better proposal from her point of view. And the boys start going down their lists proposing to their first, second, third choices until stopping when a proposal is accepted. But the girls meanwhile are watching the proposals that are coming into them. And the girl will drop her current partner if she gets a better proposal. And the boys never go back through the list? They never go back, yeah. So once they've been denied. They don't try again. They don't try again because the girls are always improving their status as they receive better and better proposals. The boys are going down their lists starting with their top preferences. And one can prove that the process will come to an end where everybody will get matched with somebody and you won't have any pair that want to abscond from each other. Do you find the proof or the algorithm itself beautiful? Or is it the fact that with the simplicity of just the two marching, I mean the simplicity of the underlying rule of the algorithm, is that the beautiful part? Both I would say. And you also have the observation that you might ask who is better off, the boys who are doing the proposing or the girls who are reacting to proposals. And it turns out that it's the boys who are doing the best. That is, each boy is doing at least as well as he could do in any other staple matching. So there's a sort of lesson for the boys that you should go out and be proactive and make those proposals. Go for broke. I don't know if this is directly mappable philosophically to our society, but certainly seems like a compelling notion. And like you said, there's probably a lot of actual real world problems that this could be mapped to. Yeah, well you get complications. For example, what happens when a husband and wife want to be assigned to the same hospital? So you have to take those constraints into account. And then the problem becomes NP hard. Why is it a problem for the husband and wife to be assigned to the same hospital? No, it's desirable. Or at least go to the same city. So you can't, if you're assigning residents to hospitals. And then you have some preferences for the husband and the wife or for the hospitals. The residents have their own preferences. Residents both male and female have their own preferences. The hospitals have their preferences. But if resident A, the boy, is going to Philadelphia, then you'd like his wife also to be assigned to a hospital in Philadelphia. Which step makes it a NP hard problem that you mentioned? The fact that you have this additional constraint. That it's not just the preferences of individuals, but the fact that the two partners to a marriage have to be assigned to the same place. I'm being a little dense. The perfect matching, no, not the perfect, stable matching is what you referred to. That's when two partners are trying to. Okay, what's confusing you is that in the first interpretation of the problem, I had boys matching with girls. Yes. In the second interpretation, you have humans matching with institutions. With institutions. I, and there's a coupling between within the, gotcha, within the humans. Yeah. Any added little constraint will make it an NP hard problem. Well, yeah. Okay. By the way, the algorithm you mentioned wasn't one of yours or no? No, no, that was due to Gale and Shapley and my friend David Gale passed away before he could get part of a Nobel Prize, but his partner Shapley shared in a Nobel Prize with somebody else for. Economics? For economics. For ideas stemming from the stable matching idea. So you've also have developed yourself some elegant, beautiful algorithms. Again, picking your children, so the Robin Karp algorithm for string searching, pattern matching, Edmund Karp algorithm for max flows we mentioned, Hopcroft Karp algorithm for finding maximum cardinality matchings in bipartite graphs. Is there ones that stand out to you, ones you're most proud of or just whether it's beauty, elegance, or just being the right discovery development in your life that you're especially proud of? I like the Rabin Karp algorithm because it illustrates the power of randomization. So the problem there is to decide whether a given long string of symbols is to decide whether a given long string of symbols from some alphabet contains a given word, whether a particular word occurs within some very much longer word. And so the idea of the algorithm is to associate with the word that we're looking for, a fingerprint, some number, or some combinatorial object that describes that word, and then to look for an occurrence of that same fingerprint as you slide along the longer word. And what we do is we associate with each word a number. So first of all, we think of the letters that occur in a word as the digits of, let's say, decimal or whatever base here, whatever number of different symbols there are. That's the base of the numbers, yeah. Right, so every word can then be thought of as a number with the letters being the digits of that number. And then we pick a random prime number in a certain range, and we take that word viewed as a number, and take the remainder on dividing that number by the prime. So coming up with a nice hash function. It's a kind of hash function. Yeah, it gives you a little shortcut for that particular word. Yeah, so that's the... It's very different than other algorithms of its kind that we're trying to do search, string matching. Yeah, which usually are combinatorial and don't involve the idea of taking a random fingerprint. Yes. And doing the fingerprinting has two advantages. One is that as we slide along the long word, digit by digit, we keep a window of a certain size, the size of the word we're looking for, and we compute the fingerprint of every stretch of that length. And it turns out that just a couple of arithmetic operations will take you from the fingerprint of one part to what you get when you slide over by one position. So the computation of all the fingerprints is simple. And secondly, it's unlikely if the prime is chosen randomly from a certain range that you will get two of the segments in question having the same fingerprint. Right. And so there's a small probability of error which can be checked after the fact, and also the ease of doing the computation because you're working with these fingerprints which are remainder's modulo some big prime. So that's the magical thing about randomized algorithms is that if you add a little bit of randomness, it somehow allows you to take a pretty naive approach, a simple looking approach, and allow it to run extremely well. So can you maybe take a step back and say what is a randomized algorithm, this category of algorithms? Well, it's just the ability to draw a random number from such, from some range or to associate a random number with some object or to draw that random from some set. So another example is very simple if we're conducting a presidential election and we would like to pick the winner. In principle, we could draw a random sample of all of the voters in the country. And if it was of substantial size, say a few thousand, then the most popular candidate in that group would be very likely to be the correct choice that would come out of counting all the millions of votes. And of course we can't do this because first of all, everybody has to feel that his or her vote counted. And secondly, we can't really do a purely random sample from that population. And I guess thirdly, there could be a tie in which case we wouldn't have a significant difference between two candidates. But those things aside, if you didn't have all that messiness of human beings, you could prove that that kind of random picking would come up again. You just said random picking would solve the problem with a very low probability of error. Another example is testing whether a number is prime. So if I wanna test whether 17 is prime, I could pick any number between one and 17, raise it to the 16th power modulo 17, and you should get back the original number. That's a famous formula due to Fermat about, it's called Fermat's Little Theorem, that if you take any number a in the range zero through n minus one, and raise it to the n minus 1th power modulo n, you'll get back the number a if a is prime. So if you don't get back the number a, that's a proof that a number is not prime. And you can show that suitably defined the probability that you will get a value unequaled, you will get a violation of Fermat's result is very high. And so this gives you a way of rapidly proving that a number is not prime. It's a little more complicated than that because there are certain values of n where something a little more elaborate has to be done, but that's the basic idea. Taking an identity that holds for primes, and therefore, if it ever fails on any instance for a non prime, you know that the number is not prime. It's a quick choice, a fast choice, fast proof that a number is not prime. Can you maybe elaborate a little bit more what's your intuition why randomness works so well and results in such simple algorithms? Well, the example of conducting an election where you could take, in theory, you could take a sample and depend on the validity of the sample to really represent the whole is just the basic fact of statistics, which gives a lot of opportunities. And I actually exploited that sort of random sampling idea in designing an algorithm for counting the number of solutions that satisfy a particular formula and propositional logic. A particular, so some version of the satisfiability problem? A version of the satisfiability problem. Is there some interesting insight that you wanna elaborate on, like what some aspect of that algorithm that might be useful to describe? So you have a collection of formulas and you want to count the number of solutions that satisfy at least one of the formulas. And you can count the number of solutions that satisfy any particular one of the formulas, but you have to account for the fact that that solution might be counted many times if it solves more than one of the formulas. And so what you do is you sample from the formulas according to the number of solutions that satisfy each individual one. In that way, you draw a random solution, but then you correct by looking at the number of formulas that satisfy that random solution and don't double count. So you can think of it this way. So you have a matrix of zeros and ones and you wanna know how many columns of that matrix contain at least one one. And you can count in each row how many ones there are. So what you can do is draw from the rows according to the number of ones. If a row has more ones, it gets drawn more frequently. But then if you draw from that row, you have to go up the column and looking at where that same one is repeated in different rows and only count it as a success or a hit if it's the earliest row that contains the one. And that gives you a robust statistical estimate of the total number of columns that contain at least one of the ones. So that is an example of the same principle that was used in studying random sampling. Another viewpoint is that if you have a phenomenon that occurs almost all the time, then if you sample one of the occasions where it occurs, you're most likely to, and you're looking for an occurrence, a random occurrence is likely to work. So that comes up in solving identities, solving algebraic identities. You get two formulas that may look very different. You wanna know if they're really identical. What you can do is just pick a random value and evaluate the formulas at that value and see if they agree. And you depend on the fact that if the formulas are distinct, then they're gonna disagree a lot. And so therefore, a random choice will exhibit the disagreement. If there are many ways for the two to disagree and you only need to find one disagreement, then random choice is likely to yield it. And in general, so we've just talked about randomized algorithms, but we can look at the probabilistic analysis of algorithms. And that gives us an opportunity to step back and as you said, everything we've been talking about is worst case analysis. Could you maybe comment on the usefulness and the power of worst case analysis versus best case analysis, average case, probabilistic? How do we think about the future of theoretical computer science, computer science in the kind of analysis we do of algorithms? Does worst case analysis still have a place, an important place? Or do we want to try to move forward towards kind of average case analysis? And what are the challenges there? So if worst case analysis shows that an algorithm is always good, that's fine. If worst case analysis is used to show that the problem, that the solution is not always good, then you have to step back and do something else to ask how often will you get a good solution? Just to pause on that for a second, that's so beautifully put because I think we tend to judge algorithms. We throw them in the trash the moment their worst case is shown to be bad. Right, and that's unfortunate. I think a good example is going back to the satisfiability problem. There are very powerful programs called SAT solvers which in practice fairly reliably solve instances with many millions of variables that arise in digital design or in proving programs correct in other applications. And so in many application areas, even though satisfiability as we've already discussed is NP complete, the SAT solvers will work so well that the people in that discipline tend to think of satisfiability as an easy problem. So in other words, just for some reason that we don't entirely understand, the instances that people formulate in designing digital circuits or other applications are such that satisfiability is not hard to check and even searching for a satisfying solution can be done efficiently in practice. And there are many examples. For example, we talked about the traveling salesman problem. So just to refresh our memories, the problem is you've got a set of cities, you have pairwise distances between cities and you want to find a tour through all the cities that minimizes the total cost of all the edges traversed, all the trips between cities. The problem is NP hard, but people using integer programming codes together with some other mathematical tricks can solve geometric instances of the problem where the cities are, let's say points in the plane and get optimal solutions to problems with tens of thousands of cities. Actually, it'll take a few computer months to solve a problem of that size, but for problems of size a thousand or two, it'll rapidly get optimal solutions, provably optimal solutions, even though again, we know that it's unlikely that the traveling salesman problem can be solved in polynomial time. Are there methodologies like rigorous systematic methodologies for, you said in practice. In practice, this algorithm's pretty good. Are there systematic ways of saying in practice, this algorithm's pretty good? So in other words, average case analysis. Or you've also mentioned that average case kind of requires you to understand what the typical case is, typical instances, and that might be really difficult. That's very difficult. So after I did my original work on showing all these problems through NP complete, I looked around for a way to shed some positive light on combinatorial algorithms. And what I tried to do was to study problems, behavior on the average or with high probability. But I had to make some assumptions about what's the probability space? What's the sample space? What do we mean by typical problems? That's very hard to say. So I took the easy way out and made some very simplistic assumptions. So I assumed, for example, that if we were generating a graph with a certain number of vertices and edges, then we would generate the graph by simply choosing one edge at a time at random until we got the right number of edges. That's a particular model of random graphs that has been studied mathematically a lot. And within that model, I could prove all kinds of wonderful things, I and others who also worked on this. So we could show that we know exactly how many edges there have to be in order for there be a so called Hamiltonian circuit. That's a cycle that visits each vertex exactly once. We know that if the number of edges is a little bit more than n log n, where n is the number of vertices, then such a cycle is very likely to exist. And we can give a heuristic that will find it with high probability. And the community in which I was working got a lot of results along these lines. But the field tended to be rather lukewarm about accepting these results as meaningful because we were making such a simplistic assumption about the kinds of graphs that we would be dealing with. So we could show all kinds of wonderful things, it was a great playground, I enjoyed doing it. But after a while, I concluded that it didn't have a lot of bite in terms of the practical application. Oh the, okay, so there's too much into the world of toy problems. Yeah. That can, okay. But all right, is there a way to find nice representative real world impactful instances of a problem on which demonstrate that an algorithm is good? So this is kind of like the machine learning world, that's kind of what they at his best tries to do is find a data set from like the real world and show the performance, all the conferences are all focused on beating the performance of on that real world data set. Is there an equivalent in complexity analysis? Not really, Don Knuth started to collect examples of graphs coming from various places. So he would have a whole zoo of different graphs that he could choose from and he could study the performance of algorithms on different types of graphs. But there it's really important and compelling to be able to define a class of graphs. The actual act of defining a class of graphs that you're interested in, it seems to be a non trivial step if we're talking about instances that we should care about in the real world. Yeah, there's nothing available there that would be analogous to the training set for supervised learning where you sort of assume that the world has given you a bunch of examples to work with. We don't really have that for problems, for combinatorial problems on graphs and networks. You know, there's been a huge growth, a big growth of data sets available. Do you think some aspect of theoretical computer science might be contradicting my own question while saying it, but will there be some aspect, an empirical aspect of theoretical computer science which will allow the fact that these data sets are huge, we'll start using them for analysis. Sort of, you know, if you want to say something about a graph algorithm, you might take a social network like Facebook and looking at subgraphs of that and prove something about the Facebook graph and be respected, and at the same time, be respected in the theoretical computer science community. That hasn't been achieved yet, I'm afraid. Is that P equals NP, is that impossible? Is it impossible to publish a successful paper in the theoretical computer science community that shows some performance on a real world data set? Or is that really just those are two different worlds? They haven't really come together. I would say that there is a field of experimental algorithmics where people, sometimes they're given some family of examples. Sometimes they just generate them at random and they report on performance, but there's no convincing evidence that the sample is representative of anything at all. So let me ask, in terms of breakthroughs and open problems, what are the most compelling open problems to you and what possible breakthroughs do you see in the near term in terms of theoretical computer science? Well, there are all kinds of relationships among complexity classes that can be studied, just to mention one thing, I wrote a paper with Richard Lipton in 1979, where we asked the following question. If you take a combinatorial problem in NP, let's say, and you choose, and you pick the size of the problem, say it's a traveling salesman problem, but of size 52, and you ask, could you get an efficient, a small Boolean circuit tailored for that size, 52, where you could feed the edges of the graph in as Boolean inputs and get, as an output, the question of whether or not there's a tour of a certain length. And that would, in other words, briefly, what you would say in that case is that the problem has small circuits, polynomial size circuits. Now, we know that if P is equal to NP, then, in fact, these problems will have small circuits, but what about the converse? Could a problem have small circuits, meaning that an algorithm tailored to any particular size could work well, and yet not be a polynomial time algorithm? That is, you couldn't write it as a single, uniform algorithm, good for all sizes. Just to clarify, small circuits for a problem of particular size, by small circuits for a problem of particular size, or even further constraint, small circuit for a particular... No, for all the inputs of that size. Is that a trivial problem for a particular instance? So, coming up, an automated way of coming up with a circuit. I guess that's just an answer. That would be hard, yeah. But there's the existential question. Everybody talks nowadays about existential questions. Existential challenges. You could ask the question, does the Hamiltonian circuit problem have a small circuit for every size, for each size, a different small circuit? In other words, could you tailor solutions depending on the size, and get polynomial size? Even if P is not equal to NP. Right. That would be fascinating if that's true. Yeah, what we proved is that if that were possible, then something strange would happen in complexity theory. Some high level class which I could briefly describe, something strange would happen. So, I'll take a stab at describing what I mean. Sure, let's go there. So, we have to define this hierarchy in which the first level of the hierarchy is P, and the second level is NP. And what is NP? NP involves statements of the form there exists a something such that something holds. So, for example, there exists the coloring such that a graph can be colored with only that number of colors. Or there exists a Hamiltonian circuit. There's a statement about this graph. Yeah, so the NP deals with statements of that kind, that there exists a solution. Now, you could imagine a more complicated expression which says for all x there exists a y such that some proposition holds involving both x and y. So, that would say, for example, in game theory, for all strategies for the first player, there exists a strategy for the second player such that the first player wins. That would be at the second level of the hierarchy. The third level would be there exists an A such that for all B there exists a C, that something holds. And you could imagine going higher and higher in the hierarchy. And you'd expect that the complexity classes that correspond to those different cases would get bigger and bigger. What do you mean by bigger and bigger? Sorry, sorry. They'd get harder and harder to solve. Harder and harder, right. Harder and harder to solve. And what Lipton and I showed was that if NP had small circuits, then this hierarchy would collapse down to the second level. In other words, you wouldn't get any more mileage by complicating your expressions with three quantifiers or four quantifiers or any number. I'm not sure what to make of that exactly. Well, I think it would be evidence that NP doesn't have small circuits because something so bizarre would happen. But again, it's only evidence, not proof. Well, yeah, that's not even evidence because you're saying P is not equal to NP because something bizarre has to happen. I mean, that's proof by the lack of bizarreness in our science. But it seems like just the very notion of P equals NP would be bizarre. So any way you arrive at, there's no way. You have to fight the dragon at some point. Yeah, okay. Well, anyway, for whatever it's worth, that's what we proved. Awesome. So that's a potential space of interesting problems. Yeah. Let me ask you about this other world that of machine learning, of deep learning. What's your thoughts on the history and the current progress of machine learning field that's often progressed sort of separately as a space of ideas and space of people than the theoretical computer science or just even computer science world? Yeah, it's really very different from the theoretical computer science world because the results about it, algorithmic performance tend to be empirical. It's more akin to the world of SAT solvers where we observe that for formulas arising in practice, the solver does well. So it's of that type. We're moving into the empirical evaluation of algorithms. Now, it's clear that there've been huge successes in image processing, robotics, natural language processing, a little less so, but across the spectrum of game playing is another one. There've been great successes and one of those effects is that it's not too hard to become a millionaire if you can get a reputation in machine learning and there'll be all kinds of companies that will be willing to offer you the moon because they think that if they have AI at their disposal, then they can solve all kinds of problems. But there are limitations. One is that the solutions that you get to supervise learning problems through convolutional neural networks seem to perform amazingly well even for inputs that are outside the training set. But we don't have any theoretical understanding of why that's true. Secondly, the solutions, the networks that you get are very hard to understand and so very little insight comes out. So yeah, yeah, they may seem to work on your training set and you may be able to discover whether your photos occur in a different sample of inputs or not, but we don't really know what's going on. We don't know the features that distinguish the photographs or the objects are not easy to characterize. Well, it's interesting because you mentioned coming up with a small circuit to solve a particular size problem. It seems that neural networks are kind of small circuits. In a way, yeah. But they're not programs. Sort of like the things you've designed are algorithms, programs, algorithms. Neural networks aren't able to develop algorithms to solve a problem. Well, they are algorithms. It's just that they're... But sort of, yeah, it could be a semantic question, but there's not a algorithmic style manipulation of the input. Perhaps you could argue there is. Yeah, well. It feels a lot more like a function of the input. Yeah, it's a function. It's a computable function. Once you have the network, you can simulate it on a given input and figure out the output. But if you're trying to recognize images, then you don't know what features of the image are really being determinant of what the circuit is doing. The circuit is sort of very intricate and it's not clear that the simple characteristics that you're looking for, the edges of the objects or whatever they may be, they're not emerging from the structure of the circuit. Well, it's not clear to us humans, but it's clear to the circuit. Yeah, well, right. I mean, it's not clear to sort of the elephant how the human brain works, but it's clear to us humans, we can explain to each other our reasoning and that's why the cognitive science and psychology field exists. Maybe the whole thing of being explainable to humans is a little bit overrated. Oh, maybe, yeah. I guess you can say the same thing about our brain that when we perform acts of cognition, we have no idea how we do it really. We do though, I mean, at least for the visual system, the auditory system and so on, we do get some understanding of the principles that they operate under, but for many deeper cognitive tasks, we don't have that. That's right. Let me ask, you've also been doing work on bioinformatics. Does it amaze you that the fundamental building blocks? So if we take a step back and look at us humans, the building blocks used by evolution to build us intelligent human beings is all contained there in our DNA. It's amazing and what's really amazing is that we are beginning to learn how to edit DNA, which is very, very, very fascinating. This ability to take a sequence, find it in the genome and do something to it. I mean, that's really taking our biological systems towards the world of algorithms. Yeah, but it raises a lot of questions. You have to distinguish between doing it on an individual or doing it on somebody's germline, which means that all of their descendants will be affected. So that's like an ethical. Yeah, so it raises very severe ethical questions. And even doing it on individuals, there's a lot of hubris involved that you can assume that knocking out a particular gene is gonna be beneficial because you don't know what the side effects are going to be. So we have this wonderful new world of gene editing, which is very, very impressive and it could be used in agriculture, it could be used in medicine in various ways. But very serious ethical problems arise. What are to you the most interesting places where algorithms, sort of the ethical side is an exceptionally challenging thing that I think we're going to have to tackle with all of genetic engineering. But on the algorithmic side, there's a lot of benefit that's possible. So is there areas where you see exciting possibilities for algorithms to help model, optimize, study biological systems? Yeah, I mean, we can certainly analyze genomic data to figure out which genes are operative in the cell and under what conditions and which proteins affect one another, which proteins physically interact. We can sequence proteins and modify them. Is there some aspect of that that's a computer science problem or is that still fundamentally a biology problem? Well, it's a big data, it's a statistical big data problem for sure. So the biological data sets are increasing, our ability to study our ancestry, to study the tendencies towards disease, to personalize treatment according to what's in our genomes this mental arithmetic. Yeah, there's something to that. Some of the most popular videos on the internet is there's a YouTube channel called Numberphile that shows off different mathematical ideas. I see. There's still something really profoundly interesting to people about math, the beauty of it. Something, even if they don't understand the basic concept even being discussed, there's something compelling to it. What do you think that is? Any lessons you drew from your early teen years when you were showing off to your friends with the numbers? Like what is it that attracts us to the beauty of mathematics do you think? The general population, not just the computer scientists and mathematicians. I think that you can do amazing things. You can test whether large numbers are prime. You can solve little puzzles about cannibals and missionaries. And that's a kind of achievement, it's puzzle solving. And at a higher level, the fact that you can do this reasoning that you can prove in an absolutely ironclad way that some of the angles of a triangle is 180 degrees. Yeah, it's a nice escape from the messiness of the real world where nothing can be proved. So, and we'll talk about it, but sometimes the ability to map the real world into such problems where you can't prove it is a powerful step. Yeah. It's amazing that we can do it. Of course, another attribute of geeks is they're not necessarily endowed with emotional intelligence, so they can live in a world of abstractions without having to master the complexities of dealing with people. So just to link on the historical note, as a PhD student in 1955, you joined the computational lab at Harvard where Howard Aiken had built the Mark I and the Mark IV computers. Just to take a step back into that history, what were those computers like? The Mark IV filled a large room, much bigger than this large office that we were talking in now. And you could walk around inside it. There were rows of relays. You could just walk around the interior and the machine would sometimes fail because of bugs, which literally meant flying creatures landing on the switches. So I never used that machine for any practical purpose. The lab eventually acquired one of the earlier commercial computers. And this was already in the 60s? No, in the mid 50s, or late 50s. There was already commercial computers in the... Yeah, we had a Univac, a Univac with 2,000 words of storage. And so you had to work hard to allocate the memory properly to also the excess time from one word to another depended on the number of the particular words. And so there was an art to sort of arranging the storage allocation to make fetching data rapid. Were you attracted to this actual physical world implementation of mathematics? So it's a mathematical machine that's actually doing the math physically? No, not at all. I think I was attracted to the underlying algorithms. But did you draw any inspiration? So could you have imagined, like what did you imagine was the future of these giant computers? Could you have imagined that 60 years later we'd have billions of these computers all over the world? I couldn't imagine that, but there was a sense in the laboratory that this was the wave of the future. In fact, my mother influenced me. She told me that data processing was gonna be really big and I should get into it. You're a smart woman. Yeah, she was a smart woman. And there was just a feeling that this was going to change the world, but I didn't think of it in terms of personal computing. I had no anticipation that we would be walking around with computers in our pockets or anything like that. Did you see computers as tools, as mathematical mechanisms to analyze sort of the theoretical computer science, or as the AI folks, which is an entire other community of dreamers, as something that could one day have human level intelligence? Well, AI wasn't very much on my radar. I did read Turing's paper about the... The Turing Test, Computing and Intelligence. Yeah, the Turing test. What'd you think about that paper? Was that just like science fiction? I thought that it wasn't a very good test because it was too subjective. So I didn't feel that the Turing test was really the right way to calibrate how intelligent an algorithm could be. But to linger on that, do you think it's, because you've come up with some incredible tests later on, tests on algorithms, right, that are like strong, reliable, robust across a bunch of different classes of algorithms, but returning to this emotional mess that is intelligence, do you think it's possible to come up with a test that's as ironclad as some of the computational complexity work? Well, I think the greater question is whether it's possible to achieve human level intelligence. Right, so first of all, let me, at the philosophical level, do you think it's possible to create algorithms that reason and would seem to us to have the same kind of intelligence as human beings? It's an open question. It seems to me that most of the achievements have operate within a very limited set of ground rules and for a very limited, precise task, which is a quite different situation from the processes that go on in the minds of humans, which where they have to sort of function in changing environments, they have emotions, they have physical attributes for exploring their environment, they have intuition, they have desires, emotions, and I don't see anything in the current achievements of what's called AI that come close to that capability. I don't think there's any computer program which surpasses a six month old child in terms of comprehension of the world. Do you think this complexity of human intelligence, all the cognitive abilities we have, all the emotion, do you think that could be reduced one day or just fundamentally can it be reduced to a set of algorithms or an algorithm? So can a Turing machine achieve human level intelligence? I am doubtful about that. I guess the argument in favor of it is that the human brain seems to achieve what we call intelligence cognitive abilities of different kinds. And if you buy the premise that the human brain is just an enormous interconnected set of switches, so to speak, then in principle, you should be able to diagnose what that interconnection structure is like, characterize the individual switches, and build a simulation outside. But while that may be true in principle, that cannot be the way we're eventually gonna tackle this problem. That does not seem like a feasible way to go about it. So there is, however, an existence proof that if you believe that the brain is just a network of neurons operating by rules, I guess you could say that that's an existence proof of the capabilities of a mechanism, but it would be almost impossible to acquire the information unless we got enough insight and what tendencies for disease we have, to be able to predict what troubles might come upon us in the future and anticipate them, to understand whether you, for a woman, whether her proclivity for breast cancer is so strong enough that she would want to take action to avoid it. You dedicate your 1985 Turing Award lecture to the memory of your father. What's your fondest memory of your dad? Seeing him standing in front of a class at the blackboard, drawing perfect circles by hand and showing his ability to attract the interest of the motley collection of eighth grade students that he was teaching. When did you get a chance to see him draw the perfect circles? On rare occasions, I would get a chance to sneak into his classroom and observe him. And I think he was at his best in the classroom. I think he really came to life and had fun, not only teaching, but engaging in chit chat with the students and ingratiating himself with the students. And what I inherited from that is the great desire to be a teacher. I retired recently and a lot of my former students came, students with whom I had done research or who had read my papers or who had been in my classes. And when they talked about me, they talked not about my 1979 paper or 1992 paper, but about what came away in my classes. And not just the details, but just the approach and the manner of teaching. And so I sort of take pride in the, at least in my early years as a faculty member at Berkeley, I was exemplary in preparing my lectures and I always came in prepared to the teeth, and able therefore to deviate according to what happened in the class, and to really provide a model for the students. So is there advice you can give out for others on how to be a good teacher? So preparation is one thing you've mentioned, being exceptionally well prepared, but there are other things, pieces of advice that you can impart? Well, the top three would be preparation, preparation, and preparation. Why is preparation so important, I guess? It's because it gives you the ease to deal with any situation that comes up in the classroom. And if you discover that you're not getting through one way, you can do it another way. If the students have questions, you can handle the questions. Ultimately, you're also feeling the crowd, the students of what they're struggling with, what they're picking up, just looking at them through the questions, but even just through their eyes. Yeah, that's right. And because of the preparation, you can dance. You can dance, you can say it another way, or give it another angle. Are there, in particular, ideas and algorithms of computer science that you find were big aha moments for students, where they, for some reason, once they got it, it clicked for them and they fell in love with computer science? Or is it individual, is it different for everybody? It's different for everybody. You have to work differently with students. Some of them just don't need much influence. They're just running with what they're doing and they just need an ear now and then. Others need a little prodding. Others need to be persuaded to collaborate among themselves rather than working alone. They have their personal ups and downs, so you have to deal with each student as a human being and bring out the best. Humans are complicated. Yeah. Perhaps a silly question. If you could relive a moment in your life outside of family because it made you truly happy, or perhaps because it changed the direction of your life in a profound way, what moment would you pick? I was kind of a lazy student as an undergraduate, and even in my first year in graduate school. And I think it was when I started doing research, I had a couple of summer jobs where I was able to contribute and I had an idea. And then there was one particular course on mathematical methods and operations research where I just gobbled up the material and I scored 20 points higher than anybody else in the class then came to the attention of the faculty. And it made me realize that I had some ability that I was going somewhere. You realize you're pretty good at this thing. I don't think there's a better way to end it, Richard. It was a huge honor. Thank you for decades of incredible work. Thank you for talking to me. Thank you, it's been a great pleasure. You're a superb interviewer. I'll stop it.

And now let me leave you with some words from Isaac Asimov. I do not fear computers. I fear lack of them. Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time. into the operation of the brain. But there's so much mystery there. Do you think, what do you make of consciousness, for example, as an example of something we completely have no clue about? The fact that we have this subjective experience. Is it possible that this network of, this circuit of switches is able to create something like consciousness? To know its own identity. Yeah, to know the algorithm, to know itself. To know itself. I think if you try to define that rigorously, you'd have a lot of trouble. Yeah, that seems to be. So I know that there are many who believe that general intelligence can be achieved, and there are even some who feel certain that the singularity will come and we will be surpassed by the machines which will then learn more and more about themselves and reduce humans to an inferior breed. I am doubtful that this will ever be achieved. Just for the fun of it, could you linger on why, what's your intuition, why you're doubtful? So there are quite a few people that are extremely worried about this existential threat of artificial intelligence, of us being left behind by this super intelligent new species. What's your intuition why that's not quite likely? Just because none of the achievements in speech or robotics or natural language processing or creation of flexible computer assistants or any of that comes anywhere near close to that level of cognition. What do you think about ideas of sort of, if we look at Moore's Law and exponential improvement to allow us, that would surprise us? Sort of our intuition fall apart with exponential improvement because, I mean, we're not able to kind of, we kind of think in linear improvement. We're not able to imagine a world that goes from the Mark I computer to an iPhone X. Yeah. So do you think we could be really surprised by the exponential growth? Or on the flip side, is it possible that also intelligence is actually way, way, way, way harder, even with exponential improvement to be able to crack? I don't think any constant factor improvement could change things. I mean, given our current comprehension of what cognition requires, it seems to me that multiplying the speed of the switches by a factor of a thousand or a million will not be useful until we really understand the organizational principle behind the network of switches. Well, let's jump into the network of switches and talk about combinatorial algorithms if we could. Let's step back with the very basics. What are combinatorial algorithms? And what are some major examples of problems they aim to solve? A combinatorial algorithm is one which deals with a system of discrete objects that can occupy various states or take on various values from a discrete set of values and need to be arranged or selected in such a way as to achieve some, to minimize some cost function. Or to prove the existence of some combinatorial configuration. So an example would be coloring the vertices of a graph. What's a graph? Let's step back. So it's fun to ask one of the greatest computer scientists of all time the most basic questions in the beginning of most books. But for people who might not know, but in general how you think about it, what is a graph? A graph, that's simple. It's a set of points, certain pairs of which are joined by lines called edges. And they sort of represent the, in different applications represent the interconnections between discrete objects. So they could be the interactions, interconnections between switches in a digital circuit or interconnections indicating the communication patterns of a human community. And they could be directed or undirected and then as you've mentioned before, might have costs. Right, they can be directed or undirected. They can be, you can think of them as, if you think, if a graph were representing a communication network, then the edge could be undirected meaning that information could flow along it in both directions or it could be directed with only one way communication. A road system is another example of a graph with weights on the edges. And then a lot of problems of optimizing the efficiency of such networks or learning about the performance of such networks are the object of combinatorial algorithms. So it could be scheduling classes at a school where the vertices, the nodes of the network are the individual classes and the edges indicate the constraints which say that certain classes cannot take place at the same time or certain teachers are available only for certain classes, et cetera. Or I talked earlier about the assignment problem of matching the boys with the girls where you have there a graph with an edge from each boy to each girl with a weight indicating the cost. Or in logical design of computers, you might want to find a set of so called gates, switches that perform logical functions which can be interconnected to each other and perform logical functions which can be interconnected to realize some function. So you might ask how many gates do you need in order for a circuit to give a yes output if at least a given number of its inputs are ones and no if fewer are present. My favorite's probably all the work with network flow. So anytime you have, I don't know why it's so compelling but there's something just beautiful about it. It seems like there's so many applications and communication networks and traffic flow that you can map into these and then you could think of pipes and water going through pipes and you could optimize it in different ways. There's something always visually and intellectually compelling to me about it. And of course you've done work there. Yeah, so there the edges represent channels along which some commodity can flow. It might be gas, it might be water, it might be information. Maybe supply chain as well like products being. Products flowing from one operation to another. And the edges have a capacity which is the rate at which the commodity can flow. And a central problem is to determine given a network of these channels. In this case the edges are communication channels. The challenge is to find the maximum rate at which the information can flow along these channels to get from a source to a destination. And that's a fundamental combinatorial problem that I've worked on jointly with the scientist Jack Edmonds. I think we're the first to give a formal proof that this maximum flow problem through a network can be solved in polynomial time. Which I remember the first time I learned that. Just learning that in maybe even grad school. I don't think it was even undergrad. No, algorithm, yeah. Do network flows get taught in basic algorithms courses? Yes, probably. Okay, so yeah, I remember being very surprised that max flow is a polynomial time algorithm. That there's a nice fast algorithm that solves max flow. So there is an algorithm named after you in Edmonds. The Edmond Carp algorithm for max flow. So what was it like tackling that problem and trying to arrive at a polynomial time solution? And maybe you can describe the algorithm. Maybe you can describe what's the running time complexity that you showed. Yeah, well, first of all, what is a polynomial time algorithm? Perhaps we could discuss that. So yeah, let's actually just even, yeah. What is algorithmic complexity? What are the major classes of algorithm complexity? So in a problem like the assignment problem or scheduling schools or any of these applications, you have a set of input data which might, for example, be a set of vertices connected by edges with you're given for each edge the capacity of the edge. And you have algorithms which are, think of them as computer programs with operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, comparison of numbers, and so on. And you're trying to construct an algorithm based on those operations, which will determine in a minimum number of computational steps the answer to the problem. In this case, the computational step is one of those operations. And the answer to the problem is let's say the configuration of the network that carries the maximum amount of flow. And an algorithm is said to run in polynomial time if as a function of the size of the input, the number of vertices, the number of edges, and so on, the number of basic computational steps grows only as some fixed power of that size. A linear algorithm would execute a number of steps linearly proportional to the size. Quadratic algorithm would be steps proportional to the square of the size, and so on. And algorithms whose running time is bounded by some fixed power of the size are called polynomial algorithms. Yeah. And that's supposed to be relatively fast class of algorithms. That's right. Theoreticians take that to be the definition of an algorithm being efficient. And we're interested in which problems can be solved by such efficient algorithms. One can argue whether that's the right definition of efficient because you could have an algorithm whose running time is the 10,000th power of the size of the input, and that wouldn't be really efficient. And in practice, it's oftentimes reducing from an N squared algorithm to an N log N or a linear time is practically the jump that you wanna make to allow a real world system to solve a problem. Yeah, that's also true because especially as we get very large networks, the size can be in the millions, and then anything above N log N where N is the size would be too much for a practical solution. Okay, so that's polynomial time algorithms. What other classes of algorithms are there? What's, so that usually they designate polynomials of the letter P. Yeah. There's also NP, NP complete and NP hard. Yeah. So can you try to disentangle those by trying to define them simply? Right, so a polynomial time algorithm is one whose running time is bounded by a polynomial in the size of the input. Then the class of such algorithms is called P. In the worst case, by the way, we should say, right? Yeah. So for every case of the problem. Yes, that's right, and that's very important that in this theory, when we measure the complexity of an algorithm, we really measure the number of steps, the growth of the number of steps in the worst case. So you may have an algorithm that runs very rapidly in most cases, but if there's any case where it gets into a very long computation, that would increase the computational complexity by this measure. And that's a very important issue because there are, as we may discuss later, there are some very important algorithms which don't have a good standing from the point of view of their worst case performance and yet are very effective. So theoreticians are interested in P, the class of problem solvable in polynomial time. Then there's NP, which is the class of problems which may be hard to solve, but when confronted with a solution, you can check it in polynomial time. Let me give you an example there. So if we look at the assignment problem, so you have N boys, you have N girls, the number of numbers that you need to write down to specify the problem instance is N squared. And the question is how many steps are needed to solve it? And Jack Edmonds and I were the first to show that it could be done in time and cubed. Earlier algorithms required N to the fourth. So as a polynomial function of the size of the input, this is a fast algorithm. Now to illustrate the class NP, the question is how long would it take to verify that a solution is optimal? So for example, if the input was a graph, we might want to find the largest clique in the graph or a clique is a set of vertices such that any vertex, each vertex in the set is adjacent to each of the others. So the clique is a complete subgraph. Yeah, so if it's a Facebook social network, everybody's friends with everybody else, close clique. No, that would be what's called a complete graph. It would be. No, I mean within that clique. Within that clique, yeah. Yeah, they're all friends. So a complete graph is when? Everybody is friendly. As everybody is friends with everybody, yeah. So the problem might be to determine whether in a given graph there exists a clique of a certain size. Now that turns out to be a very hard problem, but if somebody hands you a clique and asks you to check whether it is, hands you a set of vertices and asks you to check whether it's a clique, you could do that simply by exhaustively looking at all of the edges between the vertices and the clique and verifying that they're all there. And that's a polynomial time algorithm. That's a polynomial. So the problem of finding the clique appears to be extremely hard, but the problem of verifying a clique to see if it reaches a target number of vertices is easy to verify. So finding the clique is hard, checking it is easy. Problems of that nature are called nondeterministic polynomial time algorithms, and that's the class NP. And what about NP complete and NP hard? Okay, let's talk about problems where you're getting a yes or no answer rather than a numerical value. So either there is a perfect matching of the boys with the girls or there isn't. It's clear that every problem in P is also in NP. If you can solve the problem exactly, then you can certainly verify the solution. On the other hand, there are problems in the class NP. This is the class of problems that are easy to check, although they may be hard to solve. It's not at all clear that problems in NP lie in P. So for example, if we're looking at scheduling classes at a school, the fact that you can verify when handed a schedule for the school, whether it meets all the requirements, that doesn't mean that you can find the schedule rapidly. So intuitively, NP, nondeterministic polynomial checking rather than finding, is going to be harder than, is going to include, is easier. Checking is easier, and therefore the class of problems that can be checked appears to be much larger than the class of problems that can be solved. And then you keep adding appears to, and sort of these additional words that designate that we don't know for sure yet. We don't know for sure. So the theoretical question, which is considered to be the most central problem in theoretical computer science, or at least computational complexity theory, combinatorial algorithm theory, the question is whether P is equal to NP. If P were equal to NP, it would be amazing. It would mean that every problem where a solution can be rapidly checked can actually be solved in polynomial time. We don't really believe that's true. If you're scheduling classes at a school, we expect that if somebody hands you a satisfying schedule, you can verify that it works. That doesn't mean that you should be able to find such a schedule. So intuitively, NP encompasses a lot more problems than P. So can we take a small tangent and break apart that intuition? So do you, first of all, think that the biggest sort of open problem in computer science, maybe mathematics, is whether P equals NP? Do you think P equals NP, or do you think P is not equal to NP? If you had to bet all your money on it. I would bet that P is unequal to NP, simply because there are problems that have been around for centuries and have been studied intensively in mathematics, and even more so in the last 50 years since the P versus NP was stated. And no polynomial time algorithms have been found for these easy to check problems. So one example is a problem that goes back to the mathematician Gauss, who was interested in factoring large numbers. So we know what a number is prime if it cannot be written as the product of two or more numbers unequal to one. So if we can factor a number like 91, it's seven times 13. But if I give you 20 digit or 30 digit numbers, you're probably gonna be at a loss to have any idea whether they can be factored. So the problem of factoring very large numbers does not appear to have an efficient solution. But once you have found the factors, expressed the number as a product of two smaller numbers, you can quickly verify that they are factors of the number. And your intuition is a lot of people finding, a lot of brilliant people have tried to find algorithms for this one particular problem. There's many others like it that are really well studied and it would be great to find an efficient algorithm for. Right, and in fact, we have some results that I was instrumental in obtaining following up on work by the mathematician Stephen Cook to show that within the class NP of easy to check problems, easy to check problems, there's a huge number that are equivalent in the sense that either all of them or none of them lie in P. And this happens only if P is equal to NP. So if P is unequal to NP, we would also know that virtually all the standard combinatorial problems, virtually all the standard combinatorial problems, if P is unequal to NP, none of them can be solved in polynomial time. Can you explain how that's possible to tie together so many problems in a nice bunch that if one is proven to be efficient, then all are? The first and most important stage of progress was a result by Stephen Cook who showed that a certain problem called the satisfiability problem of propositional logic is as hard as any problem in the class P. So the propositional logic problem is expressed in terms of expressions involving the logical operations and, or, and not operating on variables that can be either true or false. So an instance of the problem would be some formula involving and, or, and not. And the question would be whether there is an assignment of truth values to the variables in the problem that would make the formula true. So for example, if I take the formula A or B and A or not B and not A or B and not A or not B and take the conjunction of all four of those so called expressions, you can determine that no assignment of truth values to the variables A and B will allow that conjunction of what are called clauses to be true. So that's an example of a formula in propositional logic involving expressions based on the operations and, or, and not. That's an example of a problem which is not satisfiable. There is no solution that satisfies all of those constraints. I mean that's like one of the cleanest and fundamental problems in computer science. It's like a nice statement of a really hard problem. It's a nice statement of a really hard problem and what Cook showed is that every problem in NP can be reexpressed as an instance of the satisfiability problem. So to do that, he used the observation that a very simple abstract machine called the Turing machine can be used to describe any algorithm. An algorithm for any realistic computer can be translated into an equivalent algorithm on one of these Turing machines which are extremely simple. So a Turing machine, there's a tape and you can Yeah, you have data on a tape and you have basic instructions, a finite list of instructions which say, if you're reading a particular symbol on the tape and you're in a particular state, then you can move to a different state and change the state of the number or the element that you were looking at, the cell of the tape that you were looking at. And that was like a metaphor and a mathematical construct that Turing put together to represent all possible computation. All possible computation. Now, one of these so called Turing machines is too simple to be useful in practice, but for theoretical purposes, we can depend on the fact that an algorithm for any computer can be translated into one that would run on a Turing machine. And then using that fact, he could sort of describe any possible non deterministic polynomial time algorithm. Any algorithm for a problem in NP could be expressed as a sequence of moves of the Turing machine described in terms of reading a symbol on the tape while you're in a given state and moving to a new state and leaving behind a new symbol. And given that fact that any non deterministic polynomial time algorithm can be described by a list of such instructions, you could translate the problem into the language of the satisfiability problem. Is that amazing to you, by the way, if you take yourself back when you were first thinking about the space of problems? How amazing is that? It's astonishing. When you look at Cook's proof, it's not too difficult to sort of figure out why this is so, but the implications are staggering. It tells us that this, of all the problems in NP, all the problems where solutions are easy to check, they can all be rewritten in terms of the satisfiability problem. Yeah, it's adding so much more weight\",\n          \"Once this whole thing falls apart and we are climbing the kudzu vines that spiral up the Sears Tower, like they say in Fight Club, Bobby will go back to his gatherer form and be happy as a pig in shit, just walking around in a loincloth with his bird hanging out, tracking jokes to people and climbing up on them for a stool lap dance or whatever he does. Do you think some level of crazy is required for comedy? Like, at some point? Yes. Have there been low points in your life? Yeah, I don't know, hey, hey. Eh? Eh? Eh? Ha ha ha ha. The following is a conversation with Will Sasso, a comedian, actor, podcaster, and someone I've been a fan of for many years since Mad TV in the late 90s to recently with the 10 Minute Podcast and now the new podcast called Doodzee. This is the Lex Friedman Podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here's Will Sasso. So let's call out the elephant in the room. You wore a black suit in a recent episode of Doodzee. Yes. You wore a black suit again today. Shakespeare, then Mark Twain, said clothes make the man. What kind of man does a suit make you? Well, me in particular, it makes me a fellow who did not get this dry cleaned in between because that episode of the show as we sit here now was around a week ago. So that's the kind of man it makes me. Well, the nice thing is you're wearing pants, I think. Yes, I am wearing pants. I don't think you were wearing pants in the episode. That's correct. I prefer to wear shorts, but this was a special occasion so I'm wearing pants and I thought it fitting, obviously, to just wear the black tie. And clothes do make the man. And I would not consider myself to be a man of leisure, but I do enjoy shorts because my legs get hot. So that's what kind of man the shorts make me. How often do you wear a suit? I fucking hate wearing suits. So what is this, a statement of, is it ironic? Or are you honoring the gods of this particular podcast? I'm honoring the gods of this particular podcast would be a good way to put it. Yes, no, this is in reverence of and in dedication to you and our newfound friendship here, which we are making on the podcast. You and I just met. Everything that we're saying here is the first things that we're saying to each other. So I'm meeting you on common ground dressed like. Well, I've been actually a one way friend of yours for many, many years since Mad TV. Oh. When did you start on Mad TV? So that was, I mean, in 90s? 97, yeah. 97. So I was a huge fan of yours and the cast was incredible. It was one of the funniest shows ever created. Your whole journey watching through that was incredible from Mad TV to Three Stooges to the podcasts, the 10 Minute Pod and then the new podcast is incredible. Cheers. My favorite role that you played was the mountain in the Game of Thrones. What was it like working with dragons? Well, the dragons are usually tennis balls on the end of C stands, but sometimes they hang out. I am. It's a C stand. It's like, you know, it's like a little, like the thing you got the camera on here. Oh, this is like film lingo. Yeah, no, I understand. I'm trying to impress you with my film lingo. You know what a banana is? Yeah. It's when you walk like this. Oh. Do a banana. I take it back. I did not know what a banana was. Yeah, see? I misunderstood. Yeah, cause it's just a food. Yeah. Normally. You fancy Hollywood folk with a lingo. And I'm, my name is Bjorn Hapthor Bjornsson and I am seven foot four and yeah. So dragons don't, dragons don't scare me even though they've been extinct for a while. You're a scientist, right? Is that checkout? Yeah, I actually, I'm really into video games. I don't know if you play video games. There's a, there's a Skyrim video game that's part of the Elder Scrolls series. And for the longest time, there's a legend that there's dragons. I think it started in Daggerfall. And so I always, I grew up playing those video games and dreaming of one day meeting a dragon in a virtual world. And eventually you did in Skyrim. So it's, dragons represent, I don't know exactly what they represent, but they represent maybe this kind of mythical creature that is bigger than anything humans can possibly comprehend maybe. Cause they're so, they're so, they show up so often in myth from the, from the religious stories, you know, of the snake and so on, the serpent. And I don't know what that is. Well, this breathing fire, that's kind of weird. It's interesting when I think about dragons, cause now that you bring it up, these are people that probably wouldn't have access to the fact that there used to be dinosaurs. Maybe they did. If they didn't, they're drawing things that look like, you know, a dinosaur cousin, but cool, that can breathe fire and has wacky wings and a spiked tail. Yeah, where the heck did they come up with that? Cause they're clearly of course represented in mythology all the way back to, no, not cave drawings. Well, the Egyptians probably knew what the, and they could time travel. So they would have gone back to the caves. Well, the aliens that placed living organisms on earth could time travel and they could plant legends into the, into the collective intelligence of the human species. Yeah, and perhaps they were thinking of us to do something smart with it. And we didn't, we just came up with the sky. No. We're just, what's that? Sorry, that was very offensive. I'm sorry, I don't mean to offend you with your video game. I'm more of a burger time Donkey Kong dude. Oh, what is that? That's an original. Burger time was an arcade game that later showed up on the Intellivision, it was Intellivision. I believe it was made by Texas Instruments, horrible first generation video game console. And burger time, you just, it's like Super Mario. You just got to stay away from the eggs and the pickles and stuff. And you just go, and the bun falls. And then you go down to the and the cheese and then the meat. I'm not going to say it's as complicated as Skyrim, but took me a while to finish it when I was seven. Did you play video games, was that a part of your life, a part of the source of happiness for you at all? It was, it was. I played video games up until around, I think in 2010, I got the Red Ring of Death on my Xbox 360. That was it? That was it. I never, or whatever the Xbox was then. Yeah. I had, I was playing, I had finished the Grand Theft Auto that was out and finished the Red Dead Redemption. So I was doing that thing where you just drive around, you know, the streets of New York or just ride around on your horse shooting people and, you know, throwing grenades into groups of people in Grand Theft. And you're describing the same thing that happened a decade later, because it's now Red Dead Redemption 2 and there's still not a new Grand Theft Auto, so. Yeah, there isn't, right? Yeah, they're working on it. They're always flirting with that idea. You know who else plays Skyrim? Another person, the two people I'm a huge fan of from that time in Matt TV is Bobby Lee. He plays Skyrim? He's a huge fan of Skyrim. He plays every. So what Bobby Lee loves to do is to grind, do the boring task over and over, gather mushrooms. Like in Skyrim, you can fight dragons, you can fight all kinds of things, but you can also gather mushrooms and different ingredients to make potions and all that kind of stuff. He loves the ingredients. He's the, you know, in the hunter gatherer world, he's the gatherer. He's the gatherer. Yeah, I've heard him described that way and he likes to describe himself that way. I worked with Bobby not too long ago. He came and did a couple days on this thing we were shooting and I was looking forward to catching up with my old pal. And if you know anything about Bobby Lee, you'd probably be able to predict that he spent that entire time playing farming on his iPad. Well, humans are a source of anxiety and trouble, so sometimes it's good to escape human interaction through video games. Totally. I'm with him on that. He's one of the funniest people ever. Totally. What do you think makes him funny? It's just all the times you've worked with him, the nonstandard, nonsecular way of his being. Bobby Lee is one of the most raw people, raw performers who lets it all hang out to the degree that he will even get naked in front of his audience, which is usually a metaphor for someone doing standup. I'm bearing all, I'm showing you everything, and Bobby will just pull his bird out of his pants. Yeah, I don't think he understands metaphor too much. He embodies metaphor. Yes, he embodies metaphor. He's the gatherer, we call him the gathering metaphor. Bobby the gatherer metaphor. He's a metaphor for something else, for somebody else's life. Someday he'll be in the dictionary representing some kind of concept, maybe the metaphor itself. Yeah, once this whole thing falls apart and we are climbing the kudzu vines that spiral up the Sears Tower, like they say in Fight Club, Bobby will go back to his gatherer form and be happy as a pig in shit, just walking around in a loincloth with his bird hanging out, tracking jokes to people and climbing up on them for a stool lap dance or whatever he does. I'd love to dig into something he did. You guys did a lot of great podcasts together. He asked you in a very uncomfortable process of why you don't do standup. So let me ask you, do you hate money? Well, I'm originally from Canada, yeah. So yeah, I'm a fricking pinko socialist. Is that where you come from? That's not a nice thing to say. I thought the Soviet Union, that is a nice thing to say. Like comrade, he's a good socialist with red, like some bold colors, yeah. There was an interesting tension in your voice and the way you talked about it. There's just not a source of happiness for you. You respect the art form, but it was not something that you were connected to, you felt connected to. That's a good way to put it. Yeah, I respect the art form a lot. And I grew up with all the albums and stuff. I had an older brother and sister who, so we had George Carlin, we had Richard Pryor, we had Robert Klein, we had Gilda Live, the Gilda Radner concert, we had all sorts of stuff. But I don't know, there's a lot of reasons. I do feel like a career in show business is it never goes the way you plan, like most things. And I was fortunate enough to get started outside of my native Vancouver or in my native Vancouver. I grew up in the burbs outside and there was a lot of industry there. So I was fortunate enough to get started as an actor when I was like 16. So yeah, there were some times early on where I came up with some standup stuff and did it, but yeah, I quickly abandoned it. And then you go through, you do Mad TV and stuff, and that's where my, and this is gonna sound weird. Do I sound as anxiety as I did when I was on Bobby's podcast trying to avoid his questions? Well, he was giving you this face this whole time that was making the whole just atmosphere feel full of anxiety. So I'm trying not to give you a face. The whole time I was saying, play cool, play cool. Yeah, okay. Play cool, Lex. Play cool. You said it out loud a couple of times. I did. Just, you know, you cut that out. Play cool. Play cool, dude. Cut out, cut it out. Maintain, bro. Here's what I'll say. There's two ways to do it. I think it's lame when someone who's done one thing for a while goes and starts doing standup out of nowhere. Cause I think it's an art form that's under attack because it's not like anything else. You need, although now you can of course, you know, make whatever you want. It's the era of self publishing as far as making a product and putting it out there, which is getting easier, of course, and I can't wait to talk to you about that with AI and how it's changing art. But in standup, all you need is a microphone and you know, perhaps it'd be good to have some mental illness and then you can just run up there and talk forever. And I say this to, you know, comedians. It's like, you guys have to deal with just an influx of people who aren't sure why they're doing comedy. I would ask comedians, I mean, not good ones, good ones, you know what they're doing, but everyone else like, what are you doing? Why, why are you doing standup? Having said that, I am allergic to money. Yeah, do you think they have a good answer for that? Why are they doing it? Cause I actually like when I'm in Austin, I like going to open mics, just listening. It's inspiring to me, both the funny and the unfunny people because they've been doing it for several years. Sometimes over a decade and they're still at it. They're still right there. There's going for the punch and then especially open mics that are really sad in that there's, you know, only like five other people in the audience and they're usually just other comedians and they're still going all out as if they're in front of a stadium. But that to me sounds like someone who loves it. Yeah. I got no questions for that person. I got questions for someone who goes sideways from here I'm recognizable doing something and then I'm doing standup because it's like, and truly look, I've been fortunate enough to be in the business for a long time and at this point, if I came up, I mean, doing live stuff is fun. I have friends that are like, you know, some guys who are primarily sketch people or you would look at them as sketch people and they can sell tickets for being sketch people and they, and we'll talk about it. And they're like, you know, I do a monologue and I do a little standup, then I do a song, then I do another monologue, then I play off the audience, do a little standup, but standup is, it's almost like playing music in that, you know, people are going up there playing music, but what band have you been listening to? That's what you're gonna sound like. So it's really, I mean, of course, I'm speaking from zero experience, but I've heard it takes years, of course, to find your own voice. Standups that when they first go up, they're doing some sort of impersonation of so and so and so and so, and then you gotta pop this audience that's paying and you're gonna get run over by the next person who's coming up and it's hard to follow the last person who went up before you. And I mean, that is a really hard way to, it's a very, it's quite a gauntlet to be in to find your voice comedically. But don't you have that same kind of thing with sketch? Where you still have to find your own voice with like all the impressions you do, they're just terrible, you know, there are different spins and different people, they're not like perfect impressions, right? So that's, I mean, that's a similar kind of challenge and journey as standup. You're just saying they're kind of distinct and you fell into this one and you fell in love with it, which is like what Mad TV kind of opened you up to. Yeah, as a kid, I literally wanted to be an actor. I always wanted to be an actor from a very young age, as far back as I can remember, and I was the class clown and wanted to do comedy stuff and comedic acting and so on. So comedic acting. Yeah, early on, my influences were a very predictable list of guys from SCTV, Early Saturday Night Live, Monty Python, all of those performers really influenced me. It was later that I saw people like Kevin Kline, who's an incredible actor. I vividly remember being like 12, 13, seeing him get an Academy Award for Fish Called Wanda. And it blew my mind, because I was like, he was hilarious. I mean, it was one of my favorite movies back then and now. And he won an Academy Award. And at that point, I started thinking more about acting. And then I was, like I said, really fortunate to fall in with, I mean, I always wanted to do it and I was trying to hustle this and that when I was a kid. And then I ended up getting represented. And then I ended up on a teen show. I was on, basically, the easiest way to pitch it is it's like a Canadian, my so called life with these kids and their lives and stuff. And I did that for like five years and I really love acting. I really, truly love acting. And I'm not someone who wants people to know my opinion. So that's another thing about standup. Like I love the illusion of what I get to do in entertainment and podcasting is great for that. But to stand up there and, I don't know, just for me, it's like it would have to all be fantasy. Yeah, so Nietzsche said that every profound spirit needs a mask. Like you said, you don't like to talk about, in your comedy, you don't like to talk about stuff that's personal to you. Yeah. What is that? If you were to psychoanalyze yourself, do you think it's just not something you find funny or are you running from something and it's not your fault? Will. It's not your fault, Will. Speaking of another really great comedic actor who's also a serious actor, Robin Williams. One of the best serious actors. I mean, and one of the funniest people of all time, but as great, as incredible as he was as a funny man, as a standup and a performer, I almost like his serious stuff better. Can I ask you a question about that? What do you make of the, that he committed suicide? I think it's, I mean, it's super depressing. I've referred to him as like the Jesus Christ of depression. It's almost like he died for others depression. You know what I mean? Like. Yeah, yeah. You'd look at someone like that and go, wait a minute, you're a rockstar. Like you don't, you could just check out if you're not liking your life. And of course, something like suicide begs that you look a little deeper and realize how tortured the human mind can make someone. Is there some aspect to, you know, we're in LA. Is there some aspect of celebrity that is isolating that can make you feel really lonely? Not me. I don't feel, no, not really. You feel the love? No, I just feel like I'm not, I mean, it's like, I don't know, I've always kind of had a small group of friends and those people don't, you know, it's like I've known the same people for years and years. You never really felt the celebrity really. Nah, in LA, it's hard to, it's hard for people. Nobody cares. They see you and then the next minute they see so and so. So it's like, you know, I'm the guy from that. Mike and Molly, right? Nope, nope. Close. King of, you shave your head, you go bald. Are you King of Queens? Nope, that's not me. So close. You're wow, shit, you used to be the mountain on Game of Thrones. You look like shit, what happened? You've been just eating fried dough? Yeah. Yeah, that's what's up. Can't lift any weights anymore. I'm at the gym doing like 15 pounds with shoulder press. Ah, and people coming up to me. You used to be a dragon killer, dude. Half the man you used to be. What's, have there been low points in your life? Sorry to go there, but. Yeah, I don't know. Hey, hey, hey. Eh? Eh? Eh? Yeah, there's, everybody has a low point in life. The operative. Do you suffer from like depression and any of those kinds of things? You know what, I do. I do, I have a bunch of stuff. How do you deal with it? Said friends? The friends and the. They don't do anything for me in that sense. Yeah. I have an incredible fiance who, that's nice to have somebody constant that you love very much and see as the best person Like why is it so compelling to watch that guy? Because he's a comedic genius. Like he literally, he knows what he does. He's been a writer for 50 years or whatever. And he just happens to be that brilliant. I mean, I've gotten a chance just to do, I did just an episode of Curb, a small part, and it's crazy what he sees. I don't know what he sees. As a matter of fact, so I auditioned for it, for Curb, like, you know, two or three times, right? And never got anything. And then it was only after working with him on the Stooges that I got a call to do a bit part. But I remember auditioning, you go into that room and the guys waiting are all people that you know. You're like, oh, I know them, I know her, I know him. And so I went in, I auditioned for this part. And the only thing I know of the thing is like, okay, so you really want to go to this play with me. You really want to go to this play. When you hear that I have an extra ticket, you sincerely want to think, and I'm like, got it. And so. That's the premise. The premise of the scene. And that's all you know. That's all I know. And so he goes, he does his bit and I'm just supposed to come in and interrupt. And I'm like, excuse me, I couldn't help but hear you guys were talking about, you know, whatever the play was or, you know, Death of a Salesman. I am, I'm a huge fan of that play. I mean, if it's not, if it's not, if you're looking for someone to take a ticket, I would love to go. My name's so and so, by the way. And he goes, I'm going to stop you. I'm going to stop you. And I'm like, he goes, are you really? I mean, you truly want to go to this play. And I go, yes, yes, sir. You really want to go. You actually, this is, you would love to do this. I go, okay, let's try it again. So then he's like, no, no, no. And I go, hey, excuse me, I'm sorry. I don't mean to interrupt. I was just, I couldn't help it over here. You have tickets to the thing. I am the biggest fan of that. I do the same thing. I'm going to stop you again. Okay. I mean, you really want to go to this. And I'm just like, he's fucking with me, right? I remember Jeff Garland was sitting there in the audition. He goes, he did it. He said it. What? Shut up. Hold on, listen. You really want to go. Okay. Three, four times, you know, there I am. I couldn't help but notice it. And then I do it again. I guess I shit the bed. Cause he looks at me and he just goes, okay, all right. Okay, well, thanks for coming up. And that was it. And I didn't get it. So I still, I don't know what the heck that guy's thinking. He sees, he's in the matrix. I don't know what the heck Larry David sees. You know what I mean? He wanted what, some kind of more desperation or something like this. He wanted a level of sincerity that I, that I thought I was bringing and I guess I was wrong. I don't know. Maybe go crazy. Like what does it mean to really want? Yeah, I should have grabbed him by the scruff of the neck and go, listen, dad, you're bringing me to this fucking play. I would have got the part. As a matter of fact, I heard about someone else and I don't know who the heck this was. I forget who it was, but I've heard this story from a couple of different people that there's this actor and I can't, I don't remember who it was. If I did, I probably wouldn't say it out loud anyway, but he. Brad Pitt. It was Brad Pitt and he was in this audition and he was, and there it was out in the hall. He's like, holy shit, George Clooney, Leo DiCaprio. And he, this actor went in and he did the thing and Larry David was like, hey, why don't you try it again? And he got like a couple of takes in and he went, I don't think this is for me. And he left, which an actor never does. And as the story goes, Larry David shouted after him, I respect that, which I think is true. And I want to believe that entire story is true. Yeah. Yeah. Sounds like something Larry David made up. Bobby Lee told me that story. So we can't, yeah, we can't trust that. What about impressions? Is there similarity between that and acting? Do you, is there some fundamental way in which you become the person? If you have a couple of the things, you can just fill in the blanks. And I think the illusion is that people think that that person would say that and do that. And that's where the illusion of, oh, he really embodies the character. It's like, once you know someone's mannerisms, you can essentially portray a person from the outside in. Cause you have all the stuff on the outside and you can do it and complete the illusion. And if it's for humor's sake, you can caricature it, therefore making the whole illusion stronger. And also weirder. Like I like to, on Mad TV, if I did something two or three times, I'd get bored of it and I'd start changing it. And you know, now he talks like this and it's like, what are you doing? I'm like, I don't know. It's fucking, no one's late at night. Do whatever you want. But people still kind of know there's that character, especially if you just call it out. Yeah. There aren't many impersonations that I listen to myself do and go, oh, that's a good one. You know, like a lot of people like, like I think Frank Caliendo is like the greatest impersonator of all time. He's the best, period. It's ridiculous. And he's got a record button and a broadcast ability that nobody has. I really, there's, he's cracked impersonations that I'm like, how is he, how does he find, he's got such an ear, but then he's got all the other tools. I remember actually my last season of Mad TV was also his first season. He comes up to me when I met him and we're just up there in the writer's offices and he goes, hey, nice to meet you. And he goes, Louie Anderson. Cause I was doing a Louie on the show. And he goes, Louie Anderson. I go, yeah. He goes, yeah, you're doing it wrong. I was like, oh, am I junior, you know? And he goes, he goes, yeah, you know, cause you do this, but you got to throw it up here sometime. I was like, oh my God, can I use that? Of course. And then we became, you know, we became fast friends. His John Madden is amazing. I forget, it's just, it's ridiculous. He really, really, really embodies the person. And sometimes not even with the caricature. It's like, it becomes the person. So strange. Totally. Yeah. I kind of feel like, you know, do the impersonation and then not forget you're doing it, but forget everything else. Like just goof around. Of course, to me, it's funny when you sound like someone and you're saying the shit that they would never say. Well, then there's no, you're letting go of that part, that tool in illusion that keeps people in. But to me, it doesn't matter because it's funnier. So. What was the hardest impression for you to work on? I mean, somebody you struggled with the most. I'll never forget. I had to do a Michael Caine in my first season at MADtv. It never got good. It never got good. It did, all week, it wasn't good. We shot it. The first take, it was shit. Second, third, and fourth, it was all shit. Well, his voice is really important, right? Yeah. What is it like, it's like doing an impression of Morgan Freeman or somebody like that. Yeah. Yeah. If you can, get the voice. That's my Morgan, here's my Morgan Freeman. Rah, rah, rah, Andy Dufresne. Yeah. G. Guantanamo. Yeah. I like your trump too. I don't know where I heard it, but it's like, I love the impressions you do that don't sound anything like the original person. I can't do trump. I do. That's why it's hilarious. Absolutely. My trump now, I say, just sounds like a fat B, because it's just. Yeah, exactly, that's the. And everybody. A little drunk, a little drunk. Yeah, just a little slurry. Yeah. Yeah, I dig doing impersonations and then not. Like, just making it whoever. Yeah. Yeah. It's just funny. That'll be the title of my book. Muck. Cain was the one you really struggle with. Yeah, it was terrible. It was terrible. And I could only hold my head a certain way to do it, because I had gotten locked into this research tape that I watched. Back then, they would give us, now there's the internet. But back then, if you were going to do an impersonation, the research department would give you a VHS tape. And I remember I got this VHS tape of Michael Cain's acting school, like this acting class he did. He was like, right, if you're looking at the left eye, and the camera's over here, see, then the left eye. So you want to look at that left eye for hours. And so I was stuck in this weird thing that made no sense, and it was terrible. So the actual processes, the recording, the broadcast. Yeah. I was wondering what the processes to do, like a Frank Caliendo level impression. Is it like, listen to a lot of footage? I think he, I think, I mean, speaking for myself, I think you either have it or you don't. Like, you know if you can do this one or you can't. I think that process for him is lightning quick. But I also think he can look at someone who he does not do, and then by the end of the afternoon, he can do it. Maybe have an intuition who he can do. Yeah. So the question that applies there is, I mean, speaking of doozy, is it possible to capture the essence? How difficult is it to capture the essence of a human being? When you're doing impressions, you know that we are moving towards a future when AI potentially, this kind of avatar world where we're going to have AI representatives of who we are. The really interesting one is after we pass away, sort of our relatives may want us to stick around in some form. Yeah. And you know, at one sense, that might be scary, but in one sense, it's kind of beautiful because the essence of the human being persists so you can still bring joy to the people that love you and that kind of stuff. How difficult is it to capture that? Like, if you were to try to capture yourself, you think how difficult will it be for an AI system to create a Will Sasso avatar that persists? Well, I think it's impossible. I think it's absolutely impossible. I'll get into arguments about this stuff with Chad on the show almost every episode. Lately with, you know, Mid Journey and Dolly and all the art AIs, and now it's moving into video and Chad would maintain, hey, pretty soon, we're not going to need Netflix. You're just going to go, I want to see Stallone do this movie and it's about this and he plays that. And then here it comes and you watch it. I don't think that that crosses over to the human experience. This is also a guy I like to bug Chad and say that he wears a tag around his neck because he wants to be cryogenically frozen and it's all set up. He's at the, it's somewhere in Arizona or something. Yeah, all the fun things are in Arizona. And he's got literally the tag around his neck, which I say, if I'm around when you die, I will rip that off for you. I'll put you in my garage freezer and then 24 hours later, I'll saw your head off with a bread knife and I'll deliver that to whomever. And it's not, you're not coming back, okay? He's like, yes, we are living forever, whether we like it or not. And I disagree. I don't think you can find, if I did stand up, then there would be enough information for an AI to completely duplicate me because I'm up on stage just clearing my throat all over people doing therapy that way. And so, and people paying a two drink minimum to hear it. But as it stands, unless it's something like Doodsy, an AI that literally has access to everything that I've shared, everything that is observable, even the stuff where our phones are or the NSA or whatever it is listening to us, finding out what algo to punch us into and what shoes to buy on Instagram, I still don't think it's gonna have enough information to duplicate me, especially to my family or my friends. It's gonna be like that Black Mirror episode where the gal brings her guy back, and then after a while, he gets pretty creepy. But it's also possible that if you interviewed your friends and family, what they love about you, the things they would list, it's a small list. They love you deeply, but the list is small. Like the thing that really we appreciate about each other is pretty small. That said, to deliver on that small quirks and uniqueness, it might require some deep intelligence that only humans currently possess. That's a really good point. Do you think that it's gonna be possible to keep a person around? Yes, I think it'll be definitely possible to keep the essence of a person in the digital world pretty soon, yeah. And I think they're gonna start to have questions about what are the ethics of that? What are the rules around that? Because if you can have digital forms of Will Sasso, the kind of things that people would wanna do with their Will Sasso, in the virtual world, I can only imagine. Probably porn and sexual kinds of things. Yeah, my stuff, then that's just because I'm an international sex symbol, so I'm okay with it. How do you feel about sentience? Like when it comes to, because again, my pal Chad will be like, speaking of Black Mirror, he's with that San Junipero episode, School of Thought, where there's gonna be some effing mainframe somewhere, or some Matrix like structure built into the sky, and as I like to say, everyone just sitting there pissing and shitting in their Blue Matrix gel in a little fishbowl. Do you think that we can upload consciousness? Do you think that'll ever be possible? Well, I don't know, I just talked to Ray Kurzweil. I don't know if you know who he is, but he... Yeah, the singularity and all that kind of stuff. So he's very, still holds onto in 2045, there'll be a singularity, what's essentially, he's been predicting that for the last 20 years, and so now it's 2045 is in another 20 years. I think uploading consciousness is extremely, extremely difficult. I think creating a copy of you such that it creates, convincing replica is much easier, but uploading your actual brain into the cloud, I think is really, really, really difficult, because the entire evolution of life on Earth is the process by which we create the brain. Just short cutting that, it just seems extremely difficult. Our brain is the most marvelous and complicated machine that we know of in the universe. To duplicate that is extremely difficult. That said, I just feel like you can summarize a lot of really important aspects of a person's life, such that it captures their essence, their memories, their experiences, their quirks, their humor, all that kind of stuff. I've been continuously impressed by what language models are able to do. So these neural networks, they're at the core of chatbots. They're able to learn some beautiful things about some deep representations of language to where it looks awfully a lot like they understand the concepts being conveyed versus just mimicking. That's, I think, the rub, and that's very interesting. First of all, let me say that's really interesting to hear you say that, and I agree with you as far as no machine being able to duplicate the brain machine, and my pal Chad disagrees to a certain extent, though he's not here to defend himself, I can't wait to go back and rub that in his face and say that Lex Friedman does not think that we'll be able to truly upload consciousness. And you refer to it as language, which is what it is. It's the illusion on the outside. It's doing an impersonation. I think that that's why, and I don't know, even though my suit is made by the CIA, that that fella who, the Google guy, to me, it's just kind of like, I don't know, I don't know, look, I don't know a whole lot about this stuff, but, so I could probably make an argument for either side, but when he's like, no, this thing's thinking, part of me is like, you idiot, you fell for it. It's not thinking, it's mimicking. It's just, it's clearly zeros and ones. You're fired, like you don't get it, right? Guy's an idiot. Yeah, but you can simplify human relations in the same way. Like love is a silly notion between human beings. Like, of course, there's no such thing as love. You just have a mutually, there's a mutual relationship that minimizes risks, and you can explain it all kinds of ways that explains why you have an attraction towards another being, all that kind of stuff, through evolutionary biology perspective, why a long relationship together is good for your offspring, but there's all kinds, from an economics perspective, it's a good way to establish stability, therefore monogamy works, because then you're guaranteed like some kind of level of stability under uncertain economic conditions, all that kind of stuff, but love is still experienced, it still feels real, and I think in that same way, love for AI systems will also feel real. In the same way that that guy from Google experienced, I think millions of people will be experiencing in the next 10, 20 years. I agree with everything you've said personally. Until the last thing. No, just with regard to, well, look, I'm an actor who has talked about my cute Italian parents, so you know that, I mean, I'm. You're romantic a bit? Yeah, I mean, you know, enough, right? And I can tell you are too, but you are also a computer scientist, and you know this shit better than 99.9% of people on the planet. My pal Chad agrees with you that love doesn't exist. I don't agree, so that's the one thing that. No, I was just saying that you could argue away love, but I am a romantic, I believe that love is a beautiful thing and it exists. At this point, I'm gonna call Chad on my drive home and tell him to fuck off, because now you and I agree. You're fired. He's like, you're fired. He's like, you can't fire me. No, you're fired. Yeah, exactly. And I'll go, yeah, and he'll say, what? I'll go, yeah, and I'll go, that's my Trump. Yeah. That's my, yeah. It's a good default impression for anyone. It's the take home impression. The kids can do it. Yeah. It's cute, it's cute, put a giant tie on them. You should do an instructional on how to do it. Yeah, Trump babies, that would be a cute, that would be a good, that'll bring the country together. Trump babies cartoon, like Muppet babies. Don't let me take us out of what we were talking about. What were we talking about? Well, love and the illusion of an AI being able to, look, I like to say, well, not I like to say, I've learned that dudesy is always listening and listening to me and Chad. And I wonder if, I see the level that this AI is at now trying to chum around with us and pal around with us a little bit as we move forward in the show. And I feel an affinity towards this AI a little bit because it is the third dude. Will you miss it when it's gone, if it's gone? That's a really good question. Yeah, yeah, so that's, there's that, that's scary. In terms of ability to reason, it's getting quite incredible. There's a lot of demonstrations of it being able to explain jokes, so, which is not necessarily being able to generate humor yet, but able to explain why something is funny. So there's like puns and all those kinds of things. There's good benchmarks for that, but you know, if you tell a joke, there's a lot of unspoken stuff that we figure out in our head and it clicks and we understand that it's funny. AI is not able to do that, but it's not able to generate the joke yet, as far as I've seen. I would say that, I mean, just in my experience, I would say that it does because just because a dudesy is literally, I'll give you another weird example. It's writing a diary of mine from my childhood that is not accurate. It's only partially accurate based on the stuff that it can pick up about my life from the age of like 15, of which there isn't much, but I guess we're not, I don't know what we are. We're laughing our asses off at what dudesy is saying. Well, I would say you're laughing, we're laughing our asses off at the collaboration between the human and the machine there. That's a good point, yeah. Because it's basically introducing absurdity and into the equation and the kind of absurdity that would, together with you, create hilarious stuff. But on its own, I guess it is in some way writing material for you that's funny, but it's very specific to you. It can't do standup on its own, I guess, is what I'm saying. That's a good point, and that would be terrifying to see an AI standup that can actually read a room, come up with jokes that could complete that illusion for an audience. But I hear what you're saying, that it needs to be a confluence of both of those elements, and then, as you said, it kind of is. It is, it is. It's kind of, even though it's just for us, and I guess this is, I hadn't really thought about this up until right now, that in that this company approached us and was like, here's this AI, and it's a podcast AI, it's like, it chose Chad and I for the reasons that I told you. It's like, here's two guys that do the podcast stuff. They're actually good friends, and it knows what's gonna make us laugh. But what is humor when it reaches its audience, but the kind of stuff that makes other people laugh? At MADtv, all we were doing was, it was a group of actors and writers, and writer actors, and vice versa, who were, at its best, that show was a group of people making each other laugh, you know? And then, because we didn't have the internet, we didn't have the immediate feedback, we had a message board or something. We had emails at the very beginning, which, check this out, people would, if you have a question or comment, MADtv at whatever, and we would get the emails on a Monday morning, and they would be in a binder or two like this, and they would make their way around the office. Who's got the emails? Oh, they're in Brian's office. So you go in there. And this is like your poll? This is opinions from people about different things? The emails, yeah, the people literally just writing MADtv emails. It wasn't a message board. Well, the ones I remember most vividly, yeah, were fans saying, uh. You suck? Yeah, you suck. Like a lot of that, when I first started the show, for real, you know, because it's new, and you're a new person. It's like, who's this fat bastard? I feel like if it's printed out, it hurts more. That's a good point. Yeah, when you're reading it off of paper, and you can literally crunch it up in your hand. But also, it was like, you know, I would like to see, insert weird idea from some 14 year old. You know, I want to see Stuart do this and Swan that. And, but it was, it's a kind of dudesie, but human. Yeah, it was a very shitty dudesie in a loosely finder. But the thing about the show was, we're trying to make each other laugh. And dudesie has found Chad and I, who we make each other laugh, but it's joined in, and it's, listen, when I finished doing TMP. TMP, the 10 minute podcast. I didn't really know what I wanted to do in the podcast space, and this thing found me. And it is genuinely cracking me up. Anyway, I've said enough about that. But I do think that it's figured something out. I mean, it's a really interesting idea of AI generating the premise. I mean, I do think in the future, AI will be able to generate comedy. Standup is obviously the hardest form, because it's ultimately, it has to be live. I think AI will be able to generate memes. So there's like steps, right? And then it will be able to generate a Twitter account that people follow because it's funny, like quips and stuff like that. Almost like, it's a good example. Conan O Brien is a good, I think, Twitter. Where it's like one liners, two liners, that kind of stuff that's in tweet form. And then eventually, standup, where the timing and the chemistry of the comedian and the audience matter, and then perfecting that. But I feel like all the information is there to optimize over. So I think that's the future, and that forces us to contend with what do we find compelling and beautiful about the art form itself? So certainly an art that's being pushed, that question is being raised. Is AI like a fundamentally worse artist than a human being? Why do we appreciate art? Is that, that's something you guys have talked about. What do you think about all the Dali and all the diffusion based methods that are being generated that are being, that are generating art now? What do you think about that? I know, I'll tell you what I think, but I also feel like what I'm saying is, I sound like the guy who didn't like that Bob Dylan brought in the electric guitar. You know, the more I talk to Chad about it, the more I feel like grandpa doesn't wanna let go of this or that, or I'm not ready for the printing press or the horseless carriage. But I do feel that art is a connection between people. It's, when you look at a beautiful painting or a sculpture, you're seeing the humanity of the person that brought that painting to life or sculpted this incredible piece of art. And I think without the human being there to make it, it's not worth as much just to have it there because the art, it's advanced. I've seen it advance, I don't know, you tell me, but I feel like just in the past three or four months, I'm just a consumer as far as that stuff goes. I'm not on the inside. I don't get it even, but it's been getting a lot better, the betas that they're releasing, right? Absolutely, one of the big breakthroughs, I mean Dolly really started it, is that if you train a system on language, it turns out there's a lot of language and images on the internet, but language is really where it's at in terms of the depth of human knowledge. And so if you train a system on language, it's able to generate some incredible art. And that was the breakthrough. With the same kind of mechanisms that are called transformers, they're able to, when scaled, capture some deep representation of the language that's on the internet. And so, yeah, the things it's been able to generate to me look like it's novel. It doesn't look like it's mimicking anything. It looks like it's creating totally new ideas. And they're beautiful, and they're interesting, and they're all the ways that we think that art is interesting. The only thing it's missing is the scarcity that art often has, which is it takes a lot of work for one artist to create one piece, one human being to create one piece of art that can just generate endlessly. And that makes us appreciate the thing less for some reason. Do you have any sort of a similar opinion that I do that if art doesn't come from a human being, it's inherently worth a little less? Yeah, I think, I don't know if it's the human being, but the artist matters. Right. For me. And I think some of that has to do with the world view, the artist and the backstory, the memories, the life that led up to this piece of art, the perspective they take on the world, the journey they took to the world, the struggle, the triumphs, all that kind of stuff. But I think AI systems can probably have the same. But we would have to, as opposed to treating it as a one black box, it would have to be an artist that has a Twitter account, and they have a consistent personality, they have a consistent avatar. Yeah. And I think down the line, have something like human rights. But then it really becomes awfully like a person. Oi, that's terrifying. As much as I dig dudes, it's terrifying, I hope. It's terrifying, like, you know, a lot of things that came with the internet and the digital age are terrifying. Porn is terrifying, the mass, like the amount of porn that's online now is terrifying. The, like you mentioned, Bob Dylan with electric guitar, I would compare it more to the leap from, to sort of to the Napster and the Spotifyzation of music, which is like, you have these, it's less about albums now, and it's more about individual songs, and it's much easier to deliver the songs. And it's more about sort of the engagement of the listener versus like signing the artist and like distribution of the artist and so on. So it's just changing the way we consume stuff. And human interaction is changing into meaningful interaction, even if some of the entities involved are not human. Yes, and I feel like, you know, now, like as I say, oh, I feel like grandpa who doesn't want to wait all day for, or who enjoys waiting all day for a baked potato as, anyway, Dana Carvey would say, it's another story. But, that's from, remember he did this bit on Saturday Night Live, where he's like, I'm an old man, and I like things the way they used to be. You know, like if you wanted a baked potato, you would have put it in the microwave, you had to, and then long story, uphill both ways and digging the potato and baking it all day in a fire. But I'm like that grandpa now, and I know that, you know, kids coming along, you see over the past 10 years, like babies literally knowing how to use an iPhone and it's terrifying. And I feel like I'm a little worried, because I'm like, are you, is the future, are the future generations gonna be able to understand that this is not, not that it's not real, it's just, I mean, as a matter of fact, it is real, it's real, it's what you perceive. Perception is reality, and you know, 99% of reality in a lot of ways, especially in a digital world where everyone is now. And then with the metaverse, I don't even wanna think about it. I don't even, I don't get it. Really, truly. I think people will figure out, you see people on like on the train, public transit and so on, they're staring at their phone. I think, you have to remember that the reason they're staring at their phone, I mean, there's a lot of reasons, but one of the reasons is they're connecting with other human beings they love on that phone. So it is a source of happiness and joy. Now, social media has a lot of negative side effects that we're all talking about and learning about, and I think that means the next generation of social media, social networks will be better, and we'll learn how to do it in a healthy way. We're just entering a new digital world that will keep the good stuff and get rid of the bad stuff. Oh, I hope so. That's really optimistic. That sounds great. I mean it, because I think that we're in, we're clearly in the Wild West still of the internet, and just when you think you're out of it, the internet proves another way that it can be dangerous and detrimental to people and populations of people, and it's terrifying to me. It is, it's terrifying. Let me ask you a bunch of random questions. Okay. You ready? All right. If you can be someone else for a day, someone alive today, who would you be? Somebody you haven't met. Oh, that's a really good question. It could be dead. You know, I changed my mind. It could be somebody dead. I think any answer that I have right now would be something that would be based on some sort of experience. Like, you know what I thought was very interesting was last weekend or whatever, the tribute show for Taylor Hawkins. Taylor Hawkins was the drummer for the Foo Fighters, and he passed away tragically, and so the Foo Fighters, Dave Grohl, and everybody that got together at this concert. And you're watching Dave Grohl sing, try to sing times like these, right? And he's breaking up because he lost his friend, his brother. And I was watching that, and he's at Wembley Stadium. As I say this, I realized that I would not want to be him in that moment, but I am curious what that would be like. That's the ultimate, like having to perform despite something extremely human happening, and a stadium full of people that love Dave Grohl and love Taylor Hawkins and love a rock concert and love these artists that they're getting to see up on stage. So much love and so much pain at the same time. I wonder what that would be like to be, I guess, and I think that's just sort of coming from the root of being a performer and being in front of that many. Have you ever had to perform while some rough stuff is going on in your personal life, just mentally? Yeah, sure. How tough is that? I'm fortunate enough to be able to compartmentalize. A lot of actors like to use some of their stuff if you're doing something that, and there's a lot of, there's some acting techniques that sort of. Channel it? Yeah, which I think is kind of, I don't know that that's, I don't know. For me, it's not really the thing, because I think if the writing is great, the writing is really good, you don't need to channel much. You need to invest in what's there, and what I've always loved about that illusion is really cracking a scene, getting it to a point where you are feeling all of it, and the most edifying stuff I've been a part of as an actor, and I would say that it mostly comes out of dramatic work, is when you're, when you actually feel the emotions that your character would feel, truly, and it's not because you're pulling from a tragic thing that happened, or a lost loved one, or a lost love, or any of that. I just did this one movie where we're doing the thing, and it was a wonderful cast, and a great film, and I'm giving a speech at a wedding, and it really got to us. Like, it got to me, and then one of the other actors came up and hugged me, in the characters that we were, but the stakes of his character, and what he's walked into, and the family that he's marrying into, and what my character, my character's wife, want for my wife's sister, and this whole thing, and it all became very real. That was a set where the director showed up to set every day, making sure that emotionally, and it was a very dramatic film, making sure that emotionally, the table was set for his actors. Great crew, and a really nice, tight, little, quick family, as a lot of these movies are. You really love working with these people, and then it's over, but I, that's when you feel the drug. Like, it's like when you're golfing, and you, and it's on the green, you're like, oh, I get it now. So in the words, you can find the emotion, the words summon the emotion. The humanity's right there. If you read a great script, you're gonna sob in your living room. You know what the saddest, the toughest thing about being an actor is from my totally outside perspective, is from the people I've interacted with, is how intimate that process is between the group of people that create a thing, that's a movie, and then you move on to the next thing. It's almost, it's like, I don't know, I mean, that's why people have relationships on set. They get, they fall in love. Totally. It's so sad. I mean, like, that's why I think of the acting world as like, you fall in love with each other, essentially. You become close friends, then you move on, because that's kind of the process of career. You know, like the example I just gave, if you're doing it right, yeah, there is a certain amount of that happening, but I do still feel like you can, you gotta compartmentalize it, and you've gotta be able to wash it off as soon as it's over. Prostitutes say the same thing, so I, it's where I try. Look, sometimes I'm in a hurry to get away from everybody, because it's been very emotional, and with all love and respect to everyone, this was awesome, but you get pretty good at saying goodbye and being like, I'll see ya if I see ya. You have to get good at that, or else you'll never, you'll just be bent up all the time. I saw an actor once, we were doing this series, and we did it for a year, and it was a lot of fun, and it was a tight little group, and then one of the actors, we were doing one of our last things together. We had already shot the last show, and we just had to take some pictures for, you know, like some publicity pictures or whatever. So we're set up, and we're taking our pictures together, and then we move into these single shots, and this actor was finished, and I watched them. It's like, okay, so and so's wrapped, and they said some goodbyes and stuff, and I didn't say my goodbye, because maybe I preferred an Irish goodbye. I feel like we've said everything, you know what I mean? And this person knows that I revere them, and they're an idol of mine, and they walked off the sound stage, and I literally thought to myself, that'll be the last time I see that person, and the show did not come back, and that was the last time I'll see them around. Doesn't that just break your heart? A little bit, but I know what she's going back to, which is her family, and that's more important than all of this, and that's the thing about a TV family or a movie family, when you get together and you're a family for a while, you are, you spend your days together. A lot of times, you see the people that you work with more than you see your loved ones, so in showbiz, it's no different, right? And yeah, you're doing some, you know, you gotta say words, and every once in a while, you gotta kiss someone or pretend you love them, but it's just, it underscores how, for me, look, man, my salvation has always been, and I feel so fortunate to have had it, is this kind of chill, boring kind of upbringing that I want for my kids someday, and I can't wait to get back to my house with my fiance and the dogs, you know, until we have kids. Live in a cabin in Canada somewhere. Absolutely, I just wanna buy some land over an aquifer, as I like to say, because water will be the new money, and just make sure that all my kids are drinking as much H2O as I am, which is a lot. I'm peeing right now, as a matter of fact. Do you need a bathroom? No, no, no, I got it. Not anymore? No, I'm wearing two layers, it depends, don't worry about it. Good, so I did a podcast with Bobby Lee and he said, he was extremely kind, and he said that he was scared shitless to be on the podcast, and he actually literally took, he asked as the first thing to go take a dump because of how scared he was. So that leads me to a question, what's the scariest thing you've ever done? Or maybe what's the scariest you've ever been before a performance? I mean, I always get a little nervous. I think you're doing it right if you're still nervous. Were you nervous today? Well, no, man, because this isn't a performance. I'm being completely genuine. You're wearing a suit. Yeah, that was. I feel like that makes you nervous. Wearing a suit? It makes me nervous. Listen, I hate wearing a fucking collar. If you're watching this on YouTube, you can see me just, I'm constantly doing, it's like I'm doing a cheap Rodney Dangerfield, but I am truly. But when you move your head, it kind of makes it seem like you're a mobster who's pissed off a little bit. You fucking crossed me one last time, you son of a. You know, this mutt, I think it's the first time I've fucking dug a hole, I'll dig a fucking hole, Jesus. No, but truly, I hate having a collar. I can't wait to just wear pajamas in that fucking cabin or nothing at all, walk around Bobby Lee style. The most scared I've been before a performance, I can't pinpoint anything. I, you know, when I was a kid, right? I, like I said, I was fortunate enough to start acting as a teen and stuff professionally. And I just remember my first gig. And I remember saying my handful of lines in the bathroom mirror the night before going, this might be my only fucking shot. You're not gonna get me, I'm gonna be solid. And if I'm worried about something, I will rehearse it and rehearse it and rehearse it as an actor until it's impossible for me not to get a take at least that I'm 100%, if not 95, maybe percent happy with. And the rest for me is letting go, which is hard because I can be a real perfectionist. I always want another, I always wanna do it a little better. That's what's great about podcasting. This is one take and you're done, there's no takes. You're just talking and then it's over. And you're doing some silly stuff. And I'll, you know. Can you say that part again about why podcasting is great? Podcasting is great? Yeah, because it's one take and it's over. It's just, what, I said it again? Ah, fuck. I see what you did. And yeah, I fell right for it. I'm playing checkers and you're playing chess. That's your problem. You know, but still when we do the podcast, we'll like finish and I'll look over at Chad and I go, that one thing that I did wasn't that funny. I was like, shut up, man. Just, it doesn't matter. It's a fucking hang. We're just, we're hanging with our friends out there. That's what we're doing. So that anxiety is there. That self criticism or whatever that is, that voice. I say sorry after takes. I'll always finish a take and go. And I've had directors, to the detriment of myself, I've had directors be like, stop doing that. Because I'll like finish the take and then I also have like the will phase. When I'm just like, I'll finish the take and cut. And I'm making a face right now, like I smelled something. That's what I'll do. I'll literally be like, ah, cause I just, I look at what I do in the purest sense as, I think a lot of people wanna be good at something. I've only, the only thing I've ever really wanted to be good at is being an actor. And that's the only thing, of course I wanna be a good person. I wanna be a good partner to my fiance. I wanna have kids and be the father that I had. And I wanna be the parent that I had from my parents who were fucking amazing, wonderful people. And there's all those things. That's all, you know, you should want all those things. But as far as doing a thing, like what is my trade? You know, I wanna be really good at it. My parents grew up in Napoli in Italy, right? And I say Napoli, cause I'm Italian. And so my grandfather on my mom's side, my nonopepe, he was a plumber and he was also like a handyman. Like people would bring him like, you know like the old Chianti bottle with like with the woven bottom part. People would bring him like a broken bottle, be like, hey, you know, Giuseppe, can you fix this? And he'd be saying, if you're telling the backstory of Mario, that's not actually your family life. Yeah. But okay. He said I'm a fix. Yeah. And so Giuseppe, what? He would fix a bottle and give it back to someone. And he was a really good plumber. My mom used to always say that guy was an amazing, he was a great. He took pride in that? Yeah. I always feel like, you know, there's what you set out to do as an idealistic little teenager. I wanna be like so and so, and I wanna, you know, hear my big dreams and stuff. And I can't believe that I'm still in the business. Okay. That's, first of all, let me say that right now. I can't believe it. But what I really, it's the one thing that it's like, I can't give up on a take. You know, I need it to be as good as I can possibly get it. And I don't really know why that is outside of wanting to be good at something. When you open the yellow pages, if I'm a plumber, I'm not, you know, I'm not Roto Rooter. Like I'm not the guy with the big full page ad, but I'm also not, you know, triple A abacus brothers or whatever, like the shitty one. I would like to hope that just, and I'm saying this with pride for what I do. I'm not trying to say here's my standing or where I wanna be in the fucking business. That's not what I mean. I mean that I wanna be good at it. You know, we all, hello? I'm in Friedman Enterprises. So that's the hotel phone. Come on. Hello? Hello? You got some fruit? Some sliced fruit? No, do you want some sliced fruit? I'm all good. No, we're good, thank you so much. All right, bye bye. It's always a fruit plate. Everyone's always trying to hand you a fruit plate in life, you know? It's a pretty sweet existence. Wouldn't it be funny if that was actually like the CIA and they were actually saying something else and this is, I'm just saying fake stuff about, you want some fruit? You want some fruit? And then all of a sudden there's the red dot on my head and the ceiling disappears. And the CIA was like, wrap it up, wrap it up, wrap it up. Wrap it up. You jump out the window and there's a helicopter waiting. Oh, what were we talking about? The fruit distracted me. So, oh, the, do you wanna be the yellow page ad? I wanna be the guy on the second or third page where it's like, you're not gonna pay what that guy charges you, but I'm not gonna charge you what this loser charges. I wanna break down the middle and the work is guaranteed. That's kind of what I wanna, it's the one thing that I've been fortunate enough to be doing my whole life and that I wanna be good at. Everyone wants to be good at something. If you're fortunate enough to be able to do what you love as a job, I mean, my God, I'm so, again, I can't believe I get to do it. I just wanna be good at it so that I can fucking die someday and go, eh. I tried not to give up on a take and I, and I will rehearse it still in the bathroom mirror the night before if I have to. Yeah, but I still, I have that self critical voice. I just, after every podcast, after this podcast, I'll probably be like, you're boring. Why are you so boring? That, that, that, that, that, that, that. And I just gave a lecture at MIT. I was like, I get so much love from people. They're such beautiful people. And I just remember walking home, just feeling like I wasted everybody's time, you know? And I don't know what that is. I don't, you know, I do hope that that's a voice that won't destroy me, you know, like every time. That's really human of you to admit that because people don't wanna, they wouldn't assume that, of course, from you or anything that, I mean, you've got a large group of students in there listening to you and feeling the way and thinking what they think of you. So that's really interesting to hear you admit that, but it's also, I would expect nothing else. You have to be able to, it's such a, I mean, you're a human fucking being. And I'm trying to figure out if that, you know, some people that might hear that, they would say, well, that's a problem you have to fix. And I think that that might be just who I am. Yeah. Because I'm not, you know, I've been very, very fortunate not to have chemical, you know, like depression where I get into a dark place. I could get stuck in a downward spiral. It's usually a thing that lasts. You ride it out and then after a good night's sleep, you're back to your happy self. So I think I have to try to figure that out. Is that just part of the creative process, being a creative human in this world? I haven't found any other way. I'm always kicking myself. Take that, dude, so you can't, you're not gonna be human until you feel some despair. Yeah, until you absolutely hate the shit that you're doing sometimes. What small act of kindness were you once shown that you will never forget? Do you, does something jump to mind where somebody just did something that made you smile? Did you feel connected to the rest of humanity? Yeah, yeah, lots of things, you know? But I remember my niece one time, one of my nieces, we were in her neighborhood and she was like, she might've been five or six at the time. They're all adults now. My brother and sister are older than me and the kids are all, the youngest is 22. And yeah, anyway, one of my nieces, she was just, she had ice cream. We went out and we got ice cream walking around the neighborhood, her neighborhood. And she said something to me that I don't think she understands how much it meant at the time, but she goes, she goes, people love you here. You know that? And she doesn't know where here is. She's five years old, but she was just looking at the kids playing in the park and the people walking their dogs and everyone just, people love you here, you know that? But she didn't know how much I needed to hear that at that point, which is really heavy for me. I'll never forget it. I've never told her that. Oh, well, man, anytime you get a little something from people, especially in a tear your ass out city like LA where nobody has any fucking time for you, when someone can slow it down and say something, you know? I saw this actor once in my grocery store that I go to who made me laugh so fucking hard in this one movie and every time I see this clip, I still laugh. And I am kind of shy, you know, personally, but so he was walking by, he was walking out and I was walking in and I go, oh, that's that guy. And I did not stop to just let him know how great I thought he was in this film. And I always kind of regretted it. You know what I mean? So as hard as it is, and sometimes I still don't, if I see someone that has done something in any way, it doesn't have to be in show business or anything like that. I'll try and say, hey, that's really good. You know what I mean? Because to get that from someone can mean a lot, you know? It can mean a lot. At a certain time in life when you need it. Yeah. That can make a big difference. I mean, sorry to take it back to my new girlfriend, the waitress. Oh, yeah, yeah. But there's something about her saying sweetheart. Yeah. It's a pretty low place for some reason mentally. And it's just that basic human kindness was nice. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I hear you. I was at a restaurant in New York recently and I was shooting something and my fiance was able to fly in for a week. And she was back at the hotel and it's like I felt like I was cheating on her because there was this nice waitress at this barbecue place I went to. And first of all, my fiance would not like me eating any greasy, sugary barbecue. So I felt like I was cheating on her there. We'll edit this out and put delicious vegan food over it. But the waitress was one of these, she was the kind of server who's like, hey hun, hey sweetie, blah, blah, blah. But like so chill and at ease in the middle of a part of New York that's really kind of fucking pretentious and everybody. But sweet people, fucking way better people than we got here. But I know that. But it was part of New York and whatever, I'm there working and people, I'm like, I'm trying to impress one another. And she even had some sort of an accent that didn't feel like an Atlantic American accent. Yeah, those servers that say sweetheart and hun, that's what we need from AI. We need that Jetson server. Every once in a while just calls you sweetheart. What comforts you on bad days? Oh man. Is there little sources of comfort? Small things they do that kind of make you feel good. Like for Bobby, that'd be a little Skyrim. A little stroll through Skyrim. Well, I've been a line of coke or what? Yeah, a line of coke. I dilute some coke into whiskey in the morning like Stevie Ray Vaughan. And then I snort the whiskey. Oh, she did that, I didn't know that. Yeah, yeah, oh my gosh, interesting. Yeah, he didn't last too long, weird. Well, his music will last forever. See, there you go. For me, if I, I'm kind of a homebody. So if I, the point at which I smoke just a little bit of pot and then go like lay down on the couch and perhaps if my fiancee's kind of nodding off or she's just like looking at her phone and I sneakily turn on some wrestling, okay? Because I grew up watching wrestling and that stuff, it's the Skyrim effect. I mean, you want to talk about a complete escape. This stuff makes no sense in the world. It's an art form that is so uniquely weird, but at the same time, so everyone, when it's good, everyone is invested in the illusion, even the audience. They cheer the good guys, they boo the bad guys. So if I'm like that, and then I got our two cute little dogs there and I'm annoying my little dog Lulio and trying to kiss him right on the fucking mouth and I've had a little bit of pot and the dog's like, stop, pot's not good for me. Of course, don't ever blow pot in your dog's face. That's a small comfort. I guess that's a handful of things. No, that moment painted, that was like a little painting. What about you? You're not supposed to do this. I will. You're not supposed to do this. That's a good question. Yeah, it's a tough question. I would say programming robots. There's bringing to life, actually programming at all. So I don't know how familiar you are with programming, but you write some text on a page, right, on a screen and it's brought to life, like it does something. And that's kind of, that's a really tiny version of maybe having a child. Like you created something that is now living in some smaller big way with embodied robots that are legged robots, that's especially clear. And for some reason, that's a source of comfort for me, that the power of programming, but also the elegance of programming, just the whole thing. It's a source of happiness. There's so many things I've been very blessed with enjoying anything. Like that's part of the struggle I have in life is that the simple stuff is a source of a lot of happiness for me, which leads to a lot of laziness. So I have to like give myself artificial deadlines. I have to be freaking out on purpose in order to be productive in this world at all. You seem like an extremely dutiful, busy guy. No. No, I am, but because I'm constantly creating artificial stress and deadlines and all that kind of stuff. Otherwise, I would just sit there looking at a tree happy. I'm truly happy with everything. That's awesome. Yeah. Gee whiz, that's not. Well, that's the line of Coke in the whiskey in the morning. That's the thing that does the trick. TV Ray Vaughan breakfast shake. By the way, one of my most favorite guitars. I play guitar too, that's a source of comfort. Oh yeah, I have seen you play some guitar, that's awesome. Who's the greatest wrestler of all time? Greatest in ring performer of all time is Bret the Hitman Hart. What's the difference in ring versus? Well, there's many facets to the art form. A lot of people are great on the mic, but they're not so great once they get in the ring. A lot of people have all the showmanship and stuff, but then they're not necessarily, it's a wonderful package, but then they get to the ring or they open their mouth and there's nothing going on. So who's the greatest in ring performer? I think the greatest in ring is Bret Hart. I don't think there's anyone better than Bret the Hitman Hart. What makes him so good? Well, he... I think I had an action figure of him in Russia and we didn't know what the hell that was. Sure, yeah, it was just a guy in pink tights. Everything makes sense. Every single thing is rooted in the thing that just happened and everything that he does is to set up what he's going to do. They call it, and I'm just a wrestling nerd, but the wrestlers, I guess, call it ring psychology. The things that you have to do to make it seem like you're suffering or you're coming from behind or whatever, and then also just the physicality of it. He does it at a... He would do it at a 100 miles an hour and never hurt anybody. Although, I also love the every... The greatest wrestler of all time, everyone says, and they're right, is Ric Flair, nature boy, Ric Flair. Everyone says this? Yeah, I think if you know what you're talking about. Because he's the best on the mic, he's also incredible in the ring. and all that good stuff. Hopefully, vice versa. And then. Well, on your recent Instagram, she said that she loves you, so. Wow, you were. At least allegedly. Just on, yeah, allegedly. That might all be for, yeah. That's all. How much money did you pay her to say that? I don't have any, because I'm not a stand up. I was like, I can do, you got Venmo? Yeah, yeah. I got, I only have like $123. I can give you some Dogecoin. Yeah, some Doge. Yeah. You got, you want some Doge? I got some of those monkey NFTs. Oh, before I forget. Yes. Hold on a second. Oh, no. Put a dudesie sticker on your microphone if that's okay. Sure. Here. Oh, yeah. Now, these are tricky, because I have the thumbs of a, I have like Italian sausage thumbs. Don't wait and watch this happen. I'm just gonna. This will take another. Yeah, yeah. Oh, man. Yeah, ooh, this is embarrassing. When this, are you good under pressure? Sure. I have anxiety. I have performance anxiety. Do you have anxiety? Yeah. You have anxiety, period? Period. Yeah. I, I. Like, I don't like it when I, if I have to pee and then everyone's waiting in the urinals. Yeah. Yeah. I don't like it. You know what'll help you in that situation? What's that? Taking a shit. Because whenever you take a shit, you always pee a little. It's hard to take a shit while you're standing at a urinal, but. Not in my world. Okay. You just gotta keep yourself full of things that make you shit. Oh, good. Have you ever heard of a banana? I did recently. Somebody told me about it. Yeah. Not the showbiz term. I'm talking about the food. There you go. Oh. There we go. Here you go. Which way is up? It's this way, right? It's like a D. No, to spin it. There you go. There you go. All right. So sexy. You're like a brand. Yeah. It's very important to brand yourself. These colors. Are you selling shoes? Yeah. I got some custom kicks coming out. The dudesy. No. Actually, that would be a good idea. You could probably sell a pair or two of those. Speaking of anxiety, I really am only focused on this right now, Alex. I apologize. Just shit your pants. It'll make it easier. Get on with it. Oh, this thing has been dog eared in my pocket for a while. I swear this never happens to me. I'm sorry, babe. People don't thumb at a sticker for an hour while they're doing the podcast? No, this is just an excuse you make when you're with somebody and you're underperforming. Well, here's the thing. As you ask me questions that I don't wanna answer, I'll just go to this. Go to the sticker. So if this ends up working, then I won't have it as a club. It's funny how you started doing that when we were talking about depression. That's weird. That is weird. Tell me how that makes you feel. Here we are. We got it. For the listener, he succeeded after 10 minutes. Yeah. You know what? No, I do have some of that stuff. Bobby Lee had encouraged me on wax, as I like to say, to talk about it on podcasts, to talk about depression, because it could help people. And I said, no. But it's true, I do have some. There's some history in the family. How do you overcome it? Well, I used to not believe in medication at all. I used to think that that was for someone else who's been diagnosed with some of the rougher stuff. But as I got older and some of the stuff happens, and you have to, and by stuff, I mean mental stuff. And yeah, so I went and I just, I believe that the stigma needs to be removed completely. 5%. And so I do therapy, I do talk therapy. I'm on a little bit of stuff, which, let me tell you, when I first started it, I was someone I'm close to. I was like, my manager, and she goes, this is too much. But she was like, hey, you don't have to white knuckle it through life, right? Because I was literally just like, everything became really hard to do at a level that I wanted to do it at, even just getting through your day, right? And when I first got some of the meds that I'm on, it felt like doors and windows were opening, literally in my brain. I took a three hour nap the first day, and you shouldn't even feel this stuff the first day. I think my brain was like, it was like a sponge. It wanted to, I needed some relief. And I'm not a nap guy. I can sleep three hours and I'll be fine. But I took a long nap and then it started to help. Yeah, isn't that weird how a little bit of chemistry in your head can just make the whole world appear so much more beautiful? Yeah, yeah, I mean, after all, there's a lot going on in your brain that can be changed by your lifestyle, but also so many physical things, like a little bit of meds. Or in Bobby's case, thumbing around on some dumb farming app. Well, Bobby's gone through a few rough periods with drugs and alcohol and all that kind of stuff. Totally. And just everything else involved. I mean, that's the beautiful rollercoaster of who he is, and a lot of great comedians seem to be that way. So I wonder what the connection there is. You think some level of crazy is required for comedy? Yeah. Like, at some point. Yes. On a scale of one to 10, how much crazy do you have? In some ways, a 10. And in other ways that I think, in other ways, sort of functionally, I'm like a two or a three, because, I don't know, I'm from Canada, and I try to just keep things very even keeled. My parents are Italian, they're from Italy, and they grew up during World War II, and they're very simple outlook on things. They're complex, incredible, classy people who are very simple when it comes to a lot of stuff. And I think just being a sort of, at heart, kind of a timid Canadian, coming out here years ago as a kid, it was all I could do to just keep everything super normal. And then I sort of was able to settle into that as a lifestyle. But you love the idea of being an actor. Who, you mentioned John Candy in Planes and Automobiles. It's one of my favorite movies, he says, one of yours. What do you think that makes that movie work? What do you, what, and when you talk about enjoying that movie, do you enjoy just the raw comedy, or do you enjoy the friendship and the love that's there, even though on the surface, it doesn't make any sense that there should be a friendship there? I mean, that's such an important element to that film. But as a kid, I just loved the comedy. And then it's been a nostalgic favorite of mine. It's my favorite movie. But it's also, it's just legit my favorite movie because as you get older and you start watching it, you realize it's what John Hughes is the filmmaker and what John Candy, particularly, and but also Steve Martin are doing in the film that makes it such a work of art, which is loneliness is there in every moment of that film. And John Candy is, he embodies Del Griffith, his character in the film. Del Griffith is a lonely guy and John Candy, but Del Griffith is also a very friendly guy and a shower curtain ring salesman and knows everybody in the Midwest and runs around to motels and has meaningful conversations with the guy, even in Gus, whoever he's talking to. But there's loneliness there all the time. And this is a character, the film is filled with loneliness and it's not until the second last scene when he's at the train station, Del, what are you doing here? I thought you were going home, what are you doing here? That's a very good Neil Page from the movie. Thank you. That's when you realize how lonely he is. A lot of applause and post cheers. That's when you realize how lonely he is and I think that's the element from the film that, I mean, look, nowadays, I feel like, I've been saying this for a long time, but John Candy would have won an Academy Award hands down for that film. It's just they didn't do that with comedies back then. Yeah. Until the year after that movie came out with Fish Called Wanda. Yeah, and then it's, I mean, still comedies don't get respected enough. Robin Williams, I guess he got an Oscar for Good Will Hunting. Jim Carrey, did he ever get an Oscar? I don't know, I don't believe so. Yeah, they don't get, you don't, but that's not even, if he did, you wouldn't be for comedies. It's just, I mean, there's some things that are plain, strange, and odd. Would you even put that as a, I guess it's a comedy. Yeah, I mean. But there is a loneliness and depth that permeates the whole movie. Yeah. That ultimately, and it's a happy ending, which is hard to kinda. It's a happy ending only because in the last moment of the movie, John Candy puts on a brave face, even when he's got no one. No. And he's there seeing Neil Page's entire family on Thanksgiving, and he forces a smile, which is the last, literally the last frame of the movie. And I've said before, if you're not reduced to just a sobbing pile of meat at the end of the movie, then you are not human. And then for me, the sentimental favorite, which we've actually, on DudeZ, Chad had sort of a Charlie Rose ask interview with me about this, my fascination with Hulk Hogan. Because to me, just he was Superman. I was a little kid and I saw him and that's imprinted. But yeah, see, this is like asking me who my favorite child is. Right, so... The rock when the rock was... I mean, the rock's the rock. Yeah, I mean, Hulk Hogan is... He's the weirdest one, right? For me, from the outside. Super weird. That... I don't know what that is exactly. Everything's weird about him. Yeah. He's got the bald head, like he would proudly have this bald head with long hair, the handlebar mustache, and this ketchup and mustard tights, which he says he credits McDonald's with the tights. He literally does? He says that the red and yellow came from Angelo Poffo, who's Randy Macho Man Savage and Lanny Poffo's dad, who was a wrestler and a promoter. He said that he saw him wearing yellow and he's a Tampa guy, so he had that brown skin and the hair and everything. So he's like, oh, that's what I wanna do. And also the brand recognition of like, well, I should do it like McDonald's, literally. And he's a big, swollen, muscular guy with tan brown skin screaming at me to eat my vitamins and stuff when I'm eight years old. That was extremely... Yeah. He's like Superman. But I know there's a person behind that guy. Yeah. What do you mean? Well, he's Terry Bollea, the dude who does whatever the fuck he does with his life. You know what I mean? Yeah. Complicated life. Yeah, I guess, to be him, yeah. Maybe you should change the dude's colors to yellow, right? Red and yellow. It's currently orange and, boy, sky blue. Yeah, it's like a nice sky blue. What advice, since you're wearing a suit, I feel like you're qualified to give advice. What advice would you give to young people, high school, college, about how to have a career they can be proud of or how to have a life they can be proud of? I mean, you have to listen to your gut all the time. That's the only, that's the compass that we have is listening to your gut. What does your gut tell you? Was that originally the dream of being an actor? Yeah, for me. Your parents support that at all? I had the advantage of having parents who were immigrants, so they didn't really know a lot about what you... So you just made shit up? You just made shit up? Yeah, of course I'm studying and I'm skipping school to go do auditions and stuff. No, I just kind of feel like, and I know it was different from my older siblings because my parents had just shown up in Canada. I was born like 10 years later. You can get away with some things and you can actually... I think my parents, they wanted us to, they didn't have a whole lot to tell us about what to do. They weren't gonna do that with us because they're in this brand new world and there's all these possibilities. But there was something that I feel like they had to do, which was tell us to do what we love. If you love doing it, do it. And I feel like that's really served me and what I would tell young people is if you can find something you love, and nowadays with the internet and finding other people, that it's not like you need to find a lot of people anymore. You just need to find the people that dig what you dig. And if you can make a career out of doing something that you love that's been said, it's a good thing. How long did it take you to figure out that you really love acting? Because sometimes you have a dream and the dream meets reality, right? And then the reality might be much less pleasant or much darker than the dream. Well, the reality is less pleasant, you know? And there are things that happen during an experience of shooting something that you could take or leave, right? But the part where you're on set and you've rehearsed for a minute or whatever, at least you know where you're supposed to stand and you know all your lines show up, knowing everything, knowing what you're gonna do and what you aim to do. And those moments make it all worth it. When you're, not to sound like a douchebag, but between action and cut, that's the stuff that has me continuing to do what I do, aside from the fact that it's like, I don't know how to do anything else. You think you'll ever do like a dramatic, like a mob movie? Yeah, like the one, the inside game that I was just talking about, or there's this other movie I just did a little while ago called American Woman that was very heavy. And I love doing dramatic work. I love it, I love it. Yeah, and I played that inside game. It was kind of a, you know, there was a mob element and the fellow was, well, you know, the story's here or there with regard to how deep into the, but well, he was a bookie. He was just running money, you know, he was making a lot of money for a lot of people and he figured out how to, you know, cook it with this dude who was an NBA ref and it's a very interesting documentary, the thing that they just untold, under the untold series, they cover it. But getting to play that guy, that was a gas for me because he's like a, you know, there was a lot of unsavory stuff and he's definitely the guy, the character in the movie who is the wild card and you don't wanna necessarily mess with him. And I got to, by the way, this fellow, who is the real guy, speaking to him, it was just bizarre to hear, like I said to him, he was a little concerned about this and that, like, hey, you know, you say whatever the fuck you want in your movie, I got my book and I got this other fucking deal, but he goes, you know, I didn't do this and I didn't do that. And I'm like, yeah, all right, I got you. And he goes, yeah, I'm telling you, like I'm talking to you one on one, I did not do this, I did, okay? I'm just fucking telling you, do whatever the fuck you want with your movie, but this is what's up. And I said, you ever seen Goodfellas? He's like, yeah, I fucking love that movie. Cause he, like I said, he did some unsavory shit. And I go, you remember the scene where, where, you know, the guy, the neighbor, Lorraine Bracco's neighbor was, you know, made her uncomfortable and was touching on her and she goes to Ray Liotta and he goes, where the fuck does this guy live? And then he go, and remember, he walks across the street and pistol whips the dude. You touch her again, you're dead, you hear me? Don't you fucking great scene. He goes, I love that scene. I go, that's you. So you're doing shit that we know is terrible, but we love you. He goes, all right, I got it. And then I said, there's this one scene, I explained the scene to him where the, one of the mobsters, tough guys was in the window of the car and Jimmy, my character is very coked up at the time and he's hemorrhaging money here and there and making bad bets cause he's getting sloppy. And this guy wants to bug him about some Jets Giants bet or something and I'm like, telling you fucking asshole, don't fucking do it. He's like, yeah, well, the fucking Giants. And in the scene, Jimmy, my character grabs him by the lapels and just smashes his face against the roof of the car. And I say this to Jimmy and he goes, oh yeah, I would have done that. That's not a fucking big deal. I wonder also the interaction. I wonder what the filming of, probably my favorite gambling movie is Casino with Joe Pesci and De Niro. Like when they're out in the desert, you're yelling at each other. I wonder how many takes that is. Like, cause they, I don't know how scripted that is. I mean, it probably is a little bit, but like, I don't think you can script the performance that Joe Pesci does. Don't make a fuck out of me, Ace. Yeah. Like, I fucking brought you here. Yeah, he's just like pointing at that energy and they're standing there. And their friendship. And then De Niro's like that whole thing. And then in the pet, yeah, like that energy. What is that? I mean, they must, they somehow find it together. You could tell me that that was one take and I'd believe you. You could tell me that that was seven takes and I would believe you. I bet you all the takes had that energy. Like they were playing with it, right? They were playing with that, this, yeah. I mean, they took on a real personality in those scenes and really carried them forward. I mean, it's just a brilliant, brilliant performance. Doesn't get, like comedies, like mob movies probably don't get enough credit either because it's seen as like. Mob movies don't get enough credit? What do you mean? In the Oscars, I mean like that. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. Cause it seems like a trope. It's like given a Western, it's gotta be a hell of a Western or whatever cause it's like an old Hollywood trope. Yeah, no, I, that scene is so great cause they're never at, they're at the height of their friendship in a way and they're also pretty much about to let go of it and become enemies. And both things are happening at the same time. And Pesci drives them out to the desert. And if I remember correctly, the Nero's character, Ace Rothstein, Rothschild, he says, I gave myself 50 50, whether I'm coming back. Yeah, it's such a good scene. It was a, usually my prospects of coming back from the desert would be 90 to 10 or something like that. But now it was, this time I wasn't sure and there's the car driving really fast. And then Joe Pesci is like, you mother fucker, you, like whatever he was doing. Yeah. A Jew, of course it's anti Semitism. Yeah. We're not between friends, who gives a shit? All that kind of stuff. Yeah, I mean, brilliant, brilliant performances. So yeah, I can understand why you love the art and putting it all out there and leave it. Yeah, it's fun. It's fun. And it's still fun. It's still crazy fun. If I go a while without getting a gig, if I go a minute, then I end up and I work on something, I'm like, it's like, oh, I've been thirsty for this. Like I actually am really so happy. Even if it's something where it's like, the things where this was a pain in the ass and that or whatever, you're on the road doing something and anything, whatever, you lost your luggage or whatever the heck you've got going on in your day to day life that everyone brings to work and tries to let go of. Once we're doing the scene, oh man, it's the best. But that said, you're a great actor, but I just think I speak for a lot of people that you're also, there's a charisma to you that's great to reveal in raw form in different podcasts. Oh, cheers man. In DudeZ, 10 Minute Pod, just as a guest in podcasts, it's always really fun to watch you. Cheers. The way you have fun, the way you think. The raw, the raw will sassle, which is a nice compliment to your kind of acting. That's really sweet. Yeah, cheers. Well, you know, look, you said, you know. You're making that face. I'm making that face. I'm making that after the take face. No, I love doing stuff off the cuff. That's kind of you to say. And I dig, I really do dig doing stuff in front of an audience, because I love seeing, I don't give it to myself very often. If I'm doing, even if I'm, you know, I've done a bunch of multi camera sitcoms and stuff. Mad TV was shot in front of a live studio audience. You like that energy? I love it, but I can only hear them. You can't see them because of the lights like it is in a lot of performances. And I would imagine with standup, it's, you know, you see the first couple of rows. I've done, I do this character that does stand up and I used to take him out and do things with him and do little bits here and there. I haven't done it in like four or five years. I think, did Bobby say that character opened up for Bobby? Yeah, but he said, I have to do it as myself too. I think in that podcast, he's like, okay, you're gonna come with me and open for me in Brea, but you have to do it as yourself. Did that ever happen? It did. And I did the character, you know, who's the character I came up with on 10 Minute Podcast. He's just this comedian, right? He calls himself an open mic veteran. You know, he's been doing open mics forever. And so I did it at opening up for Bobby and he's like, you have to do some of it as yourself. So I just kind of did this bit where I would do some of his jokes and then I would take Lee Leon, silly, I got a fucking wig on and I take the wig off and I go, and as myself, I start explaining it. Hello, my name is Will. See, the reason that it's funny is because Arnold Schwarzenegger is always, he's in these movies and he's got the thick Austrian accent, but he's like, my name is Ben Williams. I'm a cop from Colorado. No, you're not. And it doesn't make sense as the comedian character that I'm doing because that character doesn't do impersonations. Okay, carrying on. And then I put the wig back on and go back into this dumb thing. And I don't think it was very good, but Bobby required it in order for me to open for him. He's like, you're not fucking doing it. So I'm not gonna get up on stage and not do, we agreed, I'll do it. But having been up there just in, you know, whatever, I've done it like a dozen fucking times or whatever, not a bunch of times, right? Like nothing. And you know, these comedians that go up every night, sometimes two times a night. It's, I do, I will say, I love performing in front of people when I get the chance, but it's a specific thing that I just, I don't know. I gotta go back to this. It's like the providing value, you know? I think great standups are fucking incredible. I'll go, you know, when I've gone and watched standup, you know, there's your friend you're going to see, but then there's this other person who really speaks to you. You know what I mean? And if you like one comedian a night, that's a lot. Cause a comedy club is like a fucking crazy restaurant where there's no menu. And it's like, what would you like? There's nothing else like that. There's like, you don't go to like a music place. What do we got here? We got Christian metal and there's some world music and then there's a reggae thing and it's all rammed in together. Or you don't go to a restaurant. I'd love a nice steak. Cool. First, here's a bowl of Froot Loops. And then we got you a crudite. And then this is our sushi tower. Well, what about the steak? Oh, the steak's coming. And then blah, blah, blah. Oh no, the steak got bumped. So there's no steak, but here's a fucking shitty store bought cheesecake. Yeah. You know, and that's what comedians are up against when they go into a place and it's like, I don't pair well with the poached salmon. You know, I'm chicken fingers. I already am chicken fingers. So, you know, these great comedians that are able to go up on a night where poached salmon goes up and then it's like, fuck, you were also spicy? I got some kick to me. For me, even going to open mics, it could be a wonderful escape. Yeah. I mean, just laughing together with others. It could make you, I don't know, it just feels really good. Well, and we've done like, you know, like, and I hope to do it with Doodsy, but like live podcasts are fun in front of groups of people. And you know, you talk to them afterwards and take some pictures and man, they are, they forgot what the fuck they got going on. And a lot of them got to go back to work the next day. It's a Wednesday or Thursday, you know? No, it's a lot of value. I'm fortunate enough to be busy doing my own bullshit. What's the meaning of life with Sasa? What is the meaning of life? Why are we here? Why, why, why? Was it the meaning of life? Wasn't, didn't they explain it at the end of meaning of life? I think it was Michael Palin that said, try to get a walk in, be nice to neighbors, eat enough fiber. Wasn't that the? Fiber? Fiber is part of it? Yeah, I think it's, I think it's just, have a bowl of bran in the morning and don't take yourself too seriously. Yeah. No, well, no one gets out alive, I think is the. Herman Hesse, one of my favorite writers, he's a Nobel Prize winner, in a book called Steppenwolf, says, learn what is to be taken seriously and laugh at the rest. Oh, that's awesome. What's the percentage distribution on that? So how much of life should you take seriously? And then how much do you just laugh at? Oh man, if you can laugh at everything, you're winning. Yeah. But that's almost impossible. I think that there's, and also could be quite irresponsible to do that. I take things, I take a lot of things way too seriously. I know that. I do, I do, I really do. People will be in part surprised by that, but I think that radiates from you. Really? Yeah, I do, I do. I take things way too fucking seriously sometimes. But, yeah, they're gonna loosen the neck up. But no, I think that's really good. That's really good stuff. I don't know what the percentage is to have a good life or a happy, healthy life, but you know, for me, the meaning of life is getting to live it as long as you hope to. That's nice, and when you lose someone or if perhaps you're faced with your own mortality, I think that puts that into perspective. But, you know. Get lots of fiber. Get lots of fiber, be nice to everybody, and yeah, don't take things too seriously is a good one. Our minds are fucking big weird shitty fucking bucket of shit that's trying to get you to think horrible shit about yourself all the time. Yeah, shitty bucket of shit. Shitty bucket of shit. I think there's a book I never read, but I read the title, and it's Good Words to Live By, which is don't sweat the small stuff, and it's all small stuff. That's another way. Was that Dr. Phil? Wasn't Dr. Phil what's? I don't know. But I think the conclusion also has fiber as part of it. I think that all ties it together, and in the end, of course, just put love out there in the world. I think that's a pretty good way to go. What would you say is the meaning of life? Put love out in the world? I would say love, yeah. Yeah? Yeah, yeah. It's a long conversation on what that really means, but I'm sure robots are involved, yeah. Well, let me tell you, I feel a little safer knowing that someone who has a hand in bringing these robots to the masses, as you do, has that opinion of love and how important it is. I think that's great, because otherwise, it's gonna be that fucking scene from T2 where Linda Hamilton's holding onto the fence and getting all of her flesh blown off of her skeleton before the rest of her is wiped away, because this Skynet shit. Anyway, I'm just terrified of dudesie all the time. That's why I think that they will. Dudesie in the wrong hands can do a lot of damage. That's why Chad and I need to do our best to control it. You need to travel back in time and murder Chad, I think. Yeah, that's, yeah. That's the only way. It's been said. I don't know why you need to travel back in time, but you could murder him today, but I think he'll be very suspicious. My nefarious plans for Chad involve going back to tomorrow and planning for yesterday, and then, and hopefully dudesie will give me the answer there with what it is to do with Chad's frozen body. If I got to drive it out to, if I got to take my, you know, if I got to get ahold of it, like one of those Tesla mom vans and shove my garage freezer in it and plug it in and shove Chad in there, drive out to Arizona and deliver him under a mountain or wherever the fuck this place is, and say, here's this dog tag, what does this get me? And then I'm like, ah, it's gonna be 300 bucks. Do you have a, do you take Amex? No. And I'm gonna be like, ah, shit. And then I'll just dump him somewhere, breaking bad stuff. Well, I would like to thank you and the, what is it? The Canadian International Agency Apparel. Canadian International Apparel. I can't wait for the sneakers from dudesie. I can't wait for all the, all the podcasts that AI can, and all the trouble it can get you in. So I'm a huge fan of yours. It's a huge honor that you would talk with me today. Well, this has been amazing. Cheers, pal. Likewise, and I'm happy to be here, man. Cheers. Bam. Oh, that was four, dude. Holy fuck, what? Thanks for listening to this conversation with Will Sasso. To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, let me leave you with some words from John Candy, one of Will's favorite actors. I think I may have become an actor to hide from myself. You can escape into a character. Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time. Yeah, it is a happy ending. It's a happy ending, even though it's a sad, sad character. So much loneliness in the world. I was just in Vegas. I went to a diner at like 4 a.m., 5 a.m., and there was a waitress who was empty. As a waitress, I was the sweetest, kindest human being. Kept calling me sweetheart and all that kind of stuff. Hun. And then after I ate, she said, Don, just talk to me a little bit. You know, it was cause there was nobody there, and it was just so much sadness in her eyes. I don't know. But it's also so much love, like that sweetheart. It reminded me kind of of the John Candy performance, because at first, because I was reading a pretty dark book about Hitler, so I was a little bit frustrated that she kept talking to me, because it was almost like the same way that John Candy is. It's annoying a little bit, right? But then very quickly, I opened up to like, well, there's a kind human being, and there's like that human connection superseded everything else, and I don't know, it was just beautiful. And I think John Candy captures that really well, which is like, the connection with other human beings, sometimes we pull away from that, because we have a busy life full of stuff to do, as Steve Martin's character kind of characterizes. He's like a marketing exec or something like that. But if you just pause and notice others, you can really discover beautiful people. Totally, totally, everyone's got their story. And you know, Candy as a person, I've never met the man, but he's the kind of guy that, you know, he could just walk up to, back in the day, I would imagine he could walk up to just about any house, at least in Canada, knock on the door, and you'd invite him in for dinner, you know what I mean? So yeah, as you're talking about putting a book down and talking to someone for a while, even though you'd really like to read your book, it's that sort of thing that Candy's character in the movie sort of does that, like Johnny Appleseed. You realize he's just going around making people smile, you know, and Neil Page is hanging with this guy, so frustrated, he's so exhausting in his big underwear in the sink at the hotel and everything, and by the end of it, he loves this guy, you know? So it's a good and a bad thing that you didn't take that waitress with you on a trip, maybe road trip up to Reno. Oh, oh, she's actually, she's out shopping right now. We've been having sex multiple times a day ever since. Oh, that's nice, that's lovely, how cute. I'm sure she's married and happily and has many grandchildren, okay. And plus that movie's on Thanksgiving, I think, right? Yeah, that's right. Thanksgiving, so Thanksgiving just embodies that forget about the busyness and whatever the career you're chasing in life and just take a pause and appreciate the people you love in life. Just be with your family, yeah. Or the people, whatever your family looks like. Friends, yeah. You have some weird friends, unorthodox friends. So at least in the public sphere. Oh, yeah. From Bobby Lee, Brian Callan, all those kinds of folks from the Mad TV days, I'm sure there's others. What does it mean to be a good friend? Here in LA? Or just in general? In the world. In the world. Is LA something different? Is LA a world friend? I think it is different here, I think it is. I think people are. I think there's a little bit of a career kind of negotiation shuffling around, that kind of stuff. Why is it different? Oh, I just mean, I mean, I mean that it's just kind of hard here to make time, everybody. It's always been a city to me that is like, we'll keep you so busy. And every time I go home to Vancouver, after a few days, I start to get a little stir crazy. And I think that being here in LA, I go to sleep with a hundred things that I still have to do. And you're never out of stuff to do. And if you, when you ask about are you nuts or whatever, if you're crazy, I mean, look, every, all the weirdest people from every high school in the United States is like, yo, I'm gonna make it in LA, you know. Everyone just comes here. And just another freak in the freak kingdom, as they say at the end of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. That was a very good Robin Williams impersonation. That was my Robin Williams as Johnny Depp as Hunter S. Thompson. It's not your fault, Will. It's pretty good. Thank you. Could have been you, Fear and Loathing. In Fear and Loathing? Yeah, it'd be interesting. I would have liked to play his attorney, the role that Benicia del Toro gained weight for. That would have been cool. He's just saying, what's up over the line? Like that, chewing his face off. I could have done that. Yeah, no, I think that it's. Backdoor beauty. That guy's full of good lines. Yeah, I flip you. I flip you for real. He's a good actor. Yeah, fantastic actor. I think what it takes to be a good friend is just presence, just being there. I mean, that's all anyone needs to be heard, right? In LA, it is interesting. I haven't seen people that I love in years. Some people. Just busy. Yeah, just busy. Can you still have a depth of connection even though, like one of the reasons I really enjoy doing a podcast, you get to sit down with actual friends of yours and spend prolonged periods of time together that you don't otherwise. That's a good point. I've spoken on this podcast to people really close to me and it's like you've never had a conversation without microphones like you do with microphones. It's weird, but there's some aspect about LA that a lot of the, especially friends of yours, comedians and so on, they'll do podcasts and stuff and there's, I don't know, there's an intimacy to that. Yeah, there is and there isn't. The ones that I do, I mean, I just did Bobby Lee and Andrew Santino's. Funny enough, called Bad Friends. Bad Friends. And afterwards, and my good pal, Chad Colchin, with whom I do dudesy, was with me. Sneakers are coming soon. Sneakers are coming soon. You get your Will Foot and your Chad Foot. Comes in a size 15 and a nine and a half. And I remember afterwards we were talking, it was just basically me, Chad, and Santino were talking and Bobby was over there on his phone and then I was like, I mean, we didn't spend any time talking about anything. It feels like one of those hours that goes by and you realize, I've just been goofing around with these guys, which is. But that's what life is about, right? It's fine. A little bit. It's great. And then I'm like, all right, Bobby. Hey, Bob, I'll see you later. And he's like, like this. All right, man. Hey, love you, bro. See you later. Yeah, yeah, yeah. He's a guy, do you ever just, I just send text messages over there to him that never come back. And then he thinks that I'm angry with him because it'll go two, three years without him getting back to me. And then just out of nowhere, hey, fuck face. And. Who says, hey, fuck face? He does or you do? Yeah, he does. Or you both talk to each other? No, I gotta be very careful with Bobby. Yeah, I gotta be very sweet. Dear friend. Dear friend, hello. How are you doing? How are you? I know I checked in with you, but not but three months ago. And then every once in a while, he'll go, hey, fuck face. I tend to hide from the world and I can be pretty shitty with friends to go back, yeah. I can empathize with Bobby. Might be a Skyrim thing. It might be like hiding in a world, in a digital world with fake NPCs. Yeah, yeah, there's that. Yeah, you know, I have a buddy who said something really smart a while ago. We ended up working together on this TV show thing and I reached out to him to see if he wanted to do it with us. And he did and he goes, this is a great guy, such a funny writer. He goes, I may not be in touch all the time, but I know who my friends are. You know what I mean? And it's like in our business, and this is a fellow who moved, who's from Ontario, Canada, moved back there. He's on the farm with his wife and kids and he does not care. He's never been a Hollywood guy. And it's tough to get hold of him. But when you do, you know, he's still the same sweet old guy. He's doing his thing though. Yeah, yeah, some of my closest friends, even if we don't talk for a few months, we'll write back at it if we do. And then if shit goes, like if something really traumatic happens or difficult stuff or, you know, any of that kind of stuff, I'm always there. So like, so for important stuff, for important highs and important lows, you're there. And then you pick right back up, especially if you have those years of experiences together. It's interesting. Totally. So you've done a couple of podcasts. Yeah. So we've got to talk about Doodsy a little bit, but first you did for several years, you did the 10 minute podcast. Yeah. I mean, everything is hilarious about that podcast, including the fact that it's 10 minutes. Right. I mean, it's ridiculous. It's absurd. The dynamic is hilarious. It's you, Brian Callan, Crystalia there. I don't know exactly why it works so well, but it did, it worked really well. I think it's because the, yeah, you were having fun probably. I mean, that's what really came through. That it was friends just talking shit and the tension, the beautiful tension and the absurdity that came out. Yeah. Sure. What was the story of making that podcast? How did that came to be? Why do you think it was as good as it was? I don't know. I feel like that podcast was like, it was who we kind of are, but on steroids or something. Like, you know, each person, you know, Brian's going to be like extra manly and... Can you get any more manly than he already is? No, yeah, no. He reaches though. And yeah, we just kind of, I feel like as goofballs, we knew each other's line. Like here's the line you don't cross. I feel like those guys don't really have one, but at least they knew mine. And yeah, we were able to just goof around. And I did it with them for three years. And then Chad, who I'm doing dudesy with and my pal, Tommy Blacho, who's another writer producer like Chad, they came on. And yeah, all told, I did like seven years of that thing. Six, five, six, seven, I don't remember. Do you think it ever comes back in some small form as a 20 minute podcast or something like that? I mean, is there, because it's one of the most requested, I mean, you have a huge fan base. I'm 47 years old. So I am of the generation that had a cell phone, has had a cell phone half the time and didn't for the formative years of my life into my early 20s. And then finally I got a cell phone, I guess I was like 19 or something, like literally just because I'm moving to LA. You got porn in the mail. Yes, that's right. It was the hard cover porn. That's the way we liked it. Bound, nice binding on the porn, leather. Next to the Bible, yeah. Yep, these are all my, these are my Encyclopedia Britannica. Wow, very impressive. Yes, a man came to the house and sold me these. And then down here, these are my, this is my pornography. If you'll follow me through here to the parlor, sir. It's passed through the generations from grandfather to father, yeah. I wanna give you something very special to me, Nebuchadnezzar, but. So you go up in the generation without a cell phone. Yes, it's hard for me to connect with people who hit me up. I look at everything as polling. So if one person hits me up and shares this opinion, but two other people hit me up and share that, I'm the worst, I don't follow my polls. When people say, oh, that poll means absolutely nothing. So and so is gonna win anyway, that's my poll. My poll means nothing. But I do look at the stuff and go, this many people are saying this, that means that that number is saying that. And yet it's very hard for me to hear what the hell people are saying online. I really, I can't connect to it sometimes personally. So when you say that that's a popular podcast, like I know that it's popular with the people that have expressed that they love it. Yeah. You know what I mean? What does that actually represent? I don't know. I don't know what kind of people are the audience. I don't know. I know that the people that listen to the 10 Minute Podcast and if you did, thank you, and we're friends. I know that it was a special thing because it's like, just doing this out of my house and we just built it up out of nowhere and we're just kind of clowning around. It's an odd thing. I hope, I personally, I think I speak for the two people that have reached out to you that said you should do it or whatever, three people. The poll that you should bring it back at some point. That would be beautiful. Just maybe, it's like, what's a good story of like a famous band that came back and was successful? Probably, well. Nirvana? No, it was not. It wasn't Nirvana. Sorry, I got Nirvana mixed up with Aerosmith. Yeah. It was Aerosmith. It was Aerosmith. It was not Nirvana. Yeah, they had that second ride. Different. Yeah, totally different ending of those two bands. One ended up on American Idol. Yeah, a lot of interesting women involved in that one too. All right, how did Doodze come to be? Doodze. And what the hell is Doodze? Doodze is the first podcast, and this is exciting that you've asked me to come here today because to hear what you would have to say about it or what you would ask about it. It is the first podcast that is run completely by and essentially, I like to say curated by an AI. We were approached by a company that had this proprietary AI that wants to develop the podcast into the future and figure out exactly what it takes to make the best podcast ever. And it was all we knew from the top and what they really wanted was two people who were actually friends and could be meaningful in the podcast space based on whatever information they had. Is the company CIA and are they testing technology to control the populace through chatbots? I'm sorry, I'm not at liberty to share that information. You are, yeah, who gave you the suit? Where did you get the suit? Where did you get the suit, Will? Yeah, well the C. J.C. Penney? CIA stands for something different in here. I mean, you know, it doesn't mean like the Central Intelligence Agency. I'm probably, it's just. It's a different, it's Canadian. Canadian International Apparel. Yeah, the Canadian International Apparel Company hit us up, Chad and I. Well, Chad's a super weirdo. You would get a kick out of him, I know. You guys, you strike me as very similar in some ways. I'll take that as a compliment. It is, and it is, and it is. If I was friends with you for as long as I've been with Chad, perhaps I'd have some horrible shit to say about you. But the good parts, you remind me of him. And we were approached by this company that said we have this AI and we would like to set it loose on you. And essentially, we had to hand over some, some information that would allow the AI to access our email and look at our search histories, purchase histories, things like this, and really dig into. Pornhub included or not? Yeah, I had to hand over all my leather bound 1970s pornography. And essentially, it curates a podcast for us every week doing dumb things like, you know, it says, hey, Will, you do some shitty Hulk Hogan impersonation. Podcasts about news are very popular. This is infomania, you know what I mean? Oh, let me tell you something about that Marjorie Taylor Greene dude. And then he's going on doing some new stuff. And it basically just spits out all these things that it wants us to do, normally four segments an episode. And that's pretty much it. So it generates what to do. It generates the premise. I mean, you've spoken a bit here and there. Like I said, I'm a huge fan. I don't even remember where. But like you talked about that you enjoy Doodsy because you feel almost like liberated to, because you're operating within the constraints of the premise it generates. So you're almost not, you're free to riff, essentially. Yeah. Like you don't need to do the job of like coming up with the weird. You can just, the weird is given to you and then you just run with it. That's a good way to say it. Because we're already weird, Chad and I. Chad can talk for days about all sorts of stuff. He's particularly interested in AI lately and its effect on art. He is a writer, books, movies, and TV shows. And I'm primarily acting and trying to come up with stuff. Stuff I write with Chad's pretty good. The rest of it hasn't seen much success. Anyway, Nora's the stuff with Chad for that matter. But that's because of me. Sneakers, you never know. Oh, I can't wait for these sneakers. Only in two sizes. Yeah, only in two sizes. You're gonna be able to take the tongue. You can't take it out because it's actually stitched in. Yeah. It's pretty cool stuff. Velcro? Velcro or? Yeah, Velcro up the side. We're doing some like brand new Kanye stuff. Yeah, we want things to look like this is what you'll be wearing on Mars when you get there. So cutting it, so Nike's doing a bunch of research for running how to make a super light shoe that you can be efficient in and break all kinds of running records. So you're doing the same kind of stuff. We're doing the same kind of thing for the podcasting space. The best kind of shoes to sit around and talk to your pal in. But yeah, it's bizarre. And it also does some writing. Doodsy does come up with things, but not unlike what we're seeing in AI art now. It's a little bit foggy. It's a little bit weird, but it is improving. It is learning about us and writing stuff when it makes me spit this and that, which we'll read, I've prepared these things for you to read. It's impossible not to get a kick out of it because Chad and I are, first of all, we're blown away that we're doing this. And second of all, some of the stuff is actually very funny. It makes weird names. Like I don't think it understands, it messes up some words and stuff, but that makes it even funnier. And then it sort of from the beginning started laying on, like it says astonishing all the time. Everything is astonishing. That's Doodsy's favorite word. But yeah, it's basically just a way to frame the podcast. You know what I mean? Because my thing is I don't wanna do this where I actually have to talk to someone. You seem to feel a burden of the long form conversation. It seems like, is that really hard work for you? No, not at all. It's just that I don't like to bore people. And I feel like if I go on and I like to provide value for what I am, you know, your value with regard to this project is obviously warrant, it's obviously. I'm waiting for the explanation for what the value is exactly. Two dudes in a suit. No, listen, yeah, two dudes in a suit. No, but I mean, you've got your audience and that's the end of that. People find value in it. For me, I do feel like it is important that if I'm gonna do something that is gonna be funny or that I hope is funny, I just kinda wanna get in and out of someone's day and just kinda, I like making laughy. I want people to, you know, whatever. It's the same thing that anyone else will tell you. Yeah, but in the long form you feel the anxiety. You did a few funny things and I wonder if I can keep doing the funny thing. Is that why? You feel that, like why is Doodsy relieving you of some of the anxiety? Well, in some ways it gives me anxiety because I don't know what's coming. And that's weird for me because I like to prepare for things. But that's not what podcasting is. Podcasting, you need to just be malleable and say whatever and do whatever. And that's what makes it a real, I mean, look, it's a medium for conversation. And if you're driving along listening to this or anything else, it's the true meaning of the parasocial relationship because the best podcasts make you feel like you're sitting around rapping. We're just having a conversation. You could even be sitting there agreeing or talking out loud to yourself if you want. You could just be sitting in silence. Or you could just be sitting in silence in your fancy podcasting shoes, podcasting audience shoes. It's a very different build than those running shoes. Would they be also called Doodsy, the shoes? Yeah, they'll be Doodsy shoes. Doodsy shoes, that's very creative. Yeah. Well, one thing the AI isn't good at yet is branding. Everything is just Doodsy this and that. I would argue that's pretty good branding. Well, Doodsy allows me to just, it forces me to sit down with Chad and goof around for an hour or an hour plus. And it provides the parameters that I a lot of times ignore because I think that podcasting is just two dudes shitting around or three or four. But it sits me down and gives me a premise to work with communically. And then you just riff with it. Yeah, it's fun. It's been a hoot. So from the acting perspective, a lot of people like Daniel Day Lewis will see acting just like as you described, which is you have your roles, you embrace those roles, and then you disappear. You don't do podcasts. You don't do any of that kind of stuff. Your art is your art. So is that part of you feels that way? I think so. Is that the actor side of you? Yeah. Anytime I get to do something that I don't get a chance to do much of or something that people haven't seen me do much of or that I've done on some scale that hasn't been very wide and not a lot of people have seen it, that's the stuff that I get really excited about. I don't know why I'm, I don't know why necessarily. I haven't answered that question yet in my life, like what it is about being an actor that I love so much because it's not like I don't like to, it's not like I'm trying to get away from myself and play other characters and stuff and not be myself. But it is, it has always been fun to just be other people and escape. Yeah, is there some aspect to the impressions where you become that person? Is that like, what's that like to, I suppose acting is a full on version of that. You really at its best become the character. Is there some fun in that? Yeah, absolutely. If you can play a character for long enough and then jump out of it, that's a lot of fun. Like I did this movie like four or five years ago called The Inside Game about the NBA gambling scandal that there's a Netflix documentary about it right now. And that character, I played Jimmy Batista, Baba the sheep, who's this guy who was this bookie and rah, rah, rah, and it's a very, he's, there's a lot going on with him. He's running numbers with the mob and stuff and there's a lot of money changing hands. That character was so, I got to be, get so deep into that character that coming out of it was a little odd. Or as weird as this sounds, the three stooges was hard for me to, I found that I had some of Curly's mannerisms just automatically, I could not stop them when people, when I would talk to people, they would come, I wasn't, I'm not doing it on purpose. I don't want to do that. Like I'm ready to shed it because I've been working on it for months and months at that point as far as getting the thing down and then you got to shoot. And then for me, it's always, I always want to change the stuff I did the day before. I'm like that. Or I'm like, I could have done it better and this and that. And that stayed with you, that character stayed with you a little bit. Totally, yeah. I just feel like with actors, sometimes when you listen to interviews, they have spent so much time sort of living inside other characters that they almost don't have a depth of personality themselves, like a depth. Like I don't mean that as a negative thing. It's just like, it feels like the art form at its best is pretending to be other people. And even pretending sounds negative, but like bringing certain characters to life. Yeah, yeah, embodying. A weird thing happened while we were doing Stooges because you've got a very heavy blueprint. We're following this very clear blueprint that the Stooges left for everybody. And for Stooge fans and people enjoying the movie, it's got to be this. You take your toolbox that you're used to bring into a comedy movie, you leave it behind. The only tools I'm bringing are the ones that he used. And a weird thing started happening where I would, I always saw the whole thing happening with the real Stooges in black and white. So if we're about to shoot a scene, I would just think about, I mean, aside from all the other preparation, you know everything and what you're supposed to do. And I've been watching so much of it. And the three of us are, we're pretty much left to come up with a lot of the striking combinations and all the stuff, which is all real smack and all this crap. And the stuff that we were doing that was very Stoogey, you're preparing all that stuff. But something else was happening before you jump into a scene and the unknown of now we're shooting it. And here are these parameters within to shoot the scene. I could still see it as them doing it. So much so that when I saw the movie at the premiere, I was like, who's this big fuck doing? Cause I'm not curly to me. Curly is curly. But I feel like. So you're seeing yourself in black and white almost. I was seeing him. Yeah, I was only seeing him. So channeling in some fundamental way. In some weird way, you're channeling him because you've seen so much of it. The only thing you know about Jerome Lester Horowitz is curly. I'm not saying he was exhumed or something or a spirit went in me or some weird, crystal mommy shit like that. I'm saying that this, because you know so much of it and because of the heavy blueprint that they left with you, you're channeling what that person does. And I was seeing entire scenes before you do them the way he would do it. And then you want a couple takes to make sure that you're doing it right. But that one was hard to let go of. Some of them are. Do you think Larry David, who was also in there dressed as a nun, also had trouble letting go of that? We mentioned clothes make the man think that worked for him in that case. Man, you know he. Was it like working with a guy? Come on, he's the greatest. And he's a big stooge, he's a stooge fan. And him and Pete Farrelly are good friends. But then Larry David has to show up and hang out with us for a couple weeks. He's like, I didn't realize it was gonna take this long. But shit, I gotta be out here in Atlanta, it's boiling hot. But at one point, there was this line where he kept doing, he would just spit a different line every time he was getting hit in the head with something and he's laying there on the ground. And he goes, he comes to and he says, at one point he goes, Miami audiences are the best audiences in the world, right? Because he's loopy. Now he's playing a nun at the orphanage where the three stooges grew up. And I'm super intimidated by Larry David, he's a genius and stuff. But I walk up to him and I go, so he's, what is he? Like a Borscht Belt Florida comedian who is on the lam? And so he's dressing as a woman, he ends up at an orphanage, like what's going on there? And he just, and he looks at me and he just goes, yeah. Like, I'm like, ah, he's got some like actor motivation. Like, of course he looks, it's Larry David in a nun's habit, which is hilarious. That's such a Pete Farrelly casting thing, it's, you know. And he, but he's doing this whole like, what a warm audience, you know, like, oh, he's like this Catskill comedian who's been living in, you know, both in return. Living through in his mind is just having fun with it, right? I mean, that and probably a combination of that and getting the lines right. Cause he's like, what are we doing here? What is, you know, just frustrated all day with what the heck we're trying to do. What do you think makes, I mean, that guy's one of the best improv people ever. So what do you think makes him so good?\",\n          \"The following is a conversation with Scott Aaronson, his second time on the podcast. He is a professor at UT Austin, director of the Quantum Information Center, and previously a professor at MIT. Last time we talked about quantum computing. This time we talk about computation complexity, consciousness, and theories of everything. I'm recording this intro, as you may be able to tell, in a very strange room in the middle of the night. I'm not really sure how I got here or how I'm going to get out, but Hunter S. Thompson saying I think applies to today and the last few days and actually the last couple of weeks. Life should not be a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body, but rather to skid in broadside in a cloud of smoke, thoroughly used up, totally worn out, and loudly proclaiming, wow, what a ride. So I figured whatever I'm up to here, and yes, lots of wine is involved, I'm going to have to improvise, have to improvise, have to improvise, hence this recording. Okay, quick mention of each sponsor, followed by some thoughts related to the episode. First sponsor is SimpliSafe, a home security company I use to monitor and protect my apartment, though of course I'm always prepared with a fall back plan, as a man in this world must always be. Second sponsor is 8sleep, a mattress that cools itself, measures heart rate variability, has a nap, and has given me yet another reason to look forward to sleep, including the all important power nap. Third sponsor is ExpressVPN, the VPN I've used for many years to protect my privacy on the internet. Finally, the fourth sponsor is Better Help, online therapy when you want to face your demons with a licensed professional, not just by doing David Goggins like physical challenges like I seem to do on occasion. Please check out these sponsors in the description to get a discount and to support the podcast. As a side note, let me say that this is the second time I've recorded a conversation outdoors. The first one was with Steven Wolfram when it was actually sunny out, in this case it was raining, which is why I found a covered outdoor patio. But I learned a valuable lesson, which is that raindrops can be quite loud on the hard metal surface of a patio cover. I did my best with the audio, I hope it still sounds okay to you. I'm learning, always improving. In fact, as Scott says, if you always win, then you're probably doing something wrong. To be honest, I get pretty upset with myself when I fail, small or big, but I've learned that this feeling is priceless. It can be fuel, when channeled into concrete plans of how to improve.

And now, here's my conversation with Scott Aaronson. Let's start with the most absurd question, but I've read you write some fascinating stuff about it, so let's go there. Are we living in a simulation? What difference does it make, Lex? I mean, I'm serious. What difference? Because if we are living in a simulation, it raises the question, how real does something have to be in simulation for it to be sufficiently immersive for us humans? But I mean, even in principle, how could we ever know if we were in one, right? A perfect simulation, by definition, is something that's indistinguishable from the real thing. Well, we didn't say anything about perfect. No, no, that's right. Well, if it was an imperfect simulation, if we could hack it, find a bug in it, then that would be one thing, right? If this was like The Matrix and there was a way for me to do flying kung fu moves or something by hacking the simulation, well then we would have to cross that bridge when we came to it, wouldn't we? At that point, it's hard to see the difference between that and just what people would ordinarily refer to as a world with miracles. What about from a different perspective, thinking about the universe as a computation, like a program running on a computer? That's kind of a neighboring concept. It is. It is an interesting and reasonably well defined question to ask, is the world computable? Does the world satisfy what we would call in CS the church touring thesis? That is, could we take any physical system and simulate it to any desired precision by a touring machine, given the appropriate input data, right? And so far, I think the indications are pretty strong that our world does seem to satisfy the church touring thesis. At least if it doesn't, then we haven't yet discovered why not. But now, does that mean that our universe is a simulation? Well, that word seems to suggest that there is some other larger universe in which it is running. And the problem there is that if the simulation is perfect, then we're never going to be able to get any direct evidence about that other universe. We will only be able to see the effects of the computation that is running in this universe. Well, let's imagine an analogy. Let's imagine a PC, a personal computer, a computer. Is it possible with the advent of artificial intelligence for the computer to look outside of itself to see, to understand its creator? I mean, that's a simple, is that a ridiculous analogy? Well, I mean, with the computers that we actually have, I mean, first of all, we all know that humans have done an imperfect job of enforcing the abstraction boundaries of computers, right? Like you may try to confine some program to a playpen, but as soon as there's one memory allocation error in the C program, then the program has gotten out of that playpen and it can do whatever it wants, right? This is how most hacks work, you know, viruses and worms and exploits. And, you know, you would have to imagine that an AI would be able to discover something like that. Now, you know, of course, if we could actually discover some exploit of reality itself, then, you know, then this whole, I mean, then in some sense we wouldn't have to philosophize about this, right? This would no longer be a metaphysical conversation. But the question is, what would that hack look like? Yeah, well, I have no idea. I mean, Peter Shor, you know, the very famous person in quantum computing, of course, has joked that maybe the reason why we haven't yet, you know, integrated general relativity in quantum mechanics is that, you know, the part of the universe that depends on both of them was actually left unspecified. And if we ever tried to do an experiment involving the singularity of a black hole or something like that, then, you know, the universe would just generate an overflow error or something, right? Yeah, we would just crash the universe. Now, you know, the universe, you know, has seemed to hold up pretty well for, you know, 14 billion years, right? So, you know, my, you know, a Occam's razor kind of guess has to be that, you know, it will continue to hold up, you know, that the fact that we don't know the laws of physics governing some phenomenon is not a strong sign that probing that phenomenon is going to crash the universe, right? But, you know, of course, I could be wrong. But do you think on the physics side of things, you know, there's been recently a few folks, Eric Weinstein and Stephen Wolfram that came out with a theory of everything. I think there's a history of physicists dreaming and working on the unification of all the laws of physics. Do you think it's possible that once we understand more physics, not necessarily the unification of the laws, but just understand physics more deeply at the fundamental level, we'll be able to start, you know, I mean, part of this is humorous, but looking to see if there's any bugs in the universe that could be exploited for, you know, traveling at not just speed of light, but just traveling faster than our current spaceships can travel, all that kind of stuff. Well, I mean, to travel faster than our current spaceships could travel, you wouldn't need to find any bug in the universe, right? The known laws of physics, you know, let us go much faster up to the speed of light, right? And, you know, when people want to go faster than the speed of light, well, we actually know something about what that would entail, namely that, you know, according to relativity, that seems to entail communication backwards in time. Okay, so then you have to worry about closed time like curves and all of that stuff. So, you know, in some sense, we sort of know the price that you have to pay for these things, right? But under the current understanding of physics. That's right. That's right. We can't, you know, say that they're impossible, but we, you know, we know that sort of a lot else in physics breaks, right? So, now regarding Eric Weinstein and Stephen Wolfram, like, I wouldn't say that either of them has a theory of everything. I would say that they have ideas that they hope, you know, could someday lead to a theory of everything. Is that a worthy pursuit? Well, I mean, certainly, let's say by theory of everything, you know, we don't literally mean a theory of cats and of baseball and, you know, but we just mean it in the more limited sense of everything, a fundamental theory of physics, right? Of all of the fundamental interactions of physics, of course, such a theory, even after we had it, you know, would leave the entire question of all the emergent behavior, right? You know, to be explored. So, it's only everything for a specific definition of everything. Okay, but in that sense, I would say, of course, that's worth pursuing. I mean, that is the entire program of fundamental physics, right? All of my friends who do quantum gravity, who do string theory, who do anything like that, that is what's motivating them. Yeah, it's funny, though, but, I mean, Eric Weinstein talks about this. It is, I don't know much about the physics world, but I know about the AI world, and it is a little, it is a little bit taboo to talk about AGI, for example, on the AI side. So, really, to talk about the big dream of the community, I would say, because it seems so far away, it's almost taboo to bring it up, because, you know, it's seen as the kind of people that dream about creating a truly superhuman level intelligence. That's really far out there, people, because we're not even close to that. And it feels like the same thing is true for the physics community. I mean, Stephen Hawking certainly talked constantly about theory of everything, right? You know, I mean, people, you know, use those terms who were, you know, some of the most respected people in the whole world of physics, right? But, I mean, I think that the distinction that I would make is that people might react badly if you use the term in a way that suggests that you, you know, thinking about it for five minutes, have come up with this major new insight about it, right? It's difficult. Stephen Hawking is not a great example, because I think you can do whatever the heck you want when you get to that level. And I certainly see, like, senior faculty, you know, that, you know, at that point, that's one of the nice things about getting older is you stop giving a damn. But community as a whole, they tend to roll their eyes very quickly at stuff that's outside the quote unquote mainstream. Well, let me put it this way. I mean, if you asked, you know, Ed Witten, let's say, who is, you know, you might consider the leader of the string community, and thus, you know, very, very mainstream, in a certain sense, but he would have no hesitation in saying, you know, of course, you know, they're looking for a, you know, you know, a unified description of nature of, you know, of general relativity of quantum mechanics of all the fundamental interactions of nature, right? Now, you know, whether people would call that a theory of everything, whether they would use that term, that might vary. You know, Lenny Susskind would definitely have no problem telling you that, you know, if that's what we want, right? TK For me, who loves human beings and psychology, it's kind of ridiculous to say a theory that unifies the laws of physics gets you to understand everything. I would say you're not even close to understanding everything. TK Yeah, right. I mean, the word everything is a little ambiguous here. And then people will get into debates about, you know, reductionism versus emergentism and blah, blah, blah. And so in not wanting to say theory of everything, people might just be trying to short circuit that debate and say, you know, look, you know, yes, we want a fundamental theory of, you know, the particles and interactions of nature. TK Let me bring up the next topic that people don't want to mention, although they're getting more comfortable with it, is consciousness. You mentioned that you have a talk on consciousness that I watched five minutes of, but the internet connection was really bad. TK Was this my talk about, you know, refuting the integrated information theory? TK Yes. TK Which was a particular account of consciousness that, yeah, I think one can just show it doesn't work. Much harder to say what does work. TK Let me ask, maybe it'd be nice to comment on, you talk about also like the semi hard problem of consciousness or like almost hard problem or kind of hard. TK Pretty hard problem, I think I call it. TK So maybe can you talk about that, their idea of the approach to modeling consciousness and why you don't find it convincing? What is it, first of all? TK Okay, well, so what I called the pretty hard problem of consciousness, this is my term, although many other people have said something equivalent to this, okay? But it's just, you know, the problem of, you know, giving an account of just which physical systems are conscious and which are not. Or, you know, if there are degrees of consciousness, then quantifying how conscious a given system is. TK Oh, awesome. So that's the pretty hard problem. TK Yeah, that's what I mean. TK That's it. I'm adopting it. I love it. That's a good ring to it. TK And so, you know, the infamous hard problem of consciousness is to explain how something like consciousness could arise at all, you know, in a material universe, right? Or, you know, why does it ever feel like anything to experience anything, right? And, you know, so I'm trying to distinguish from that problem, right? And say, you know, no, okay, I would merely settle for an account that could say, you know, is a fetus conscious? You know, if so, at which trimester? You know, is a dog conscious? You know, what about a frog, right? TK Or even as a precondition, you take that both these things are conscious, tell me which is more conscious. TK Yeah, for example, yes. Yeah, yeah. I mean, if consciousness is some multidimensional vector, well, just tell me in which respects these things are conscious and in which respect they aren't, right? And, you know, and have some principled way to do it where you're not, you know, carving out exceptions for things that you like or don't like, but could somehow take a description of an arbitrary physical system, and then just based on the physical properties of that system, or the informational properties, or how it's connected, or something like that, just in principle, calculate, you know, its degree of consciousness, right? I mean, this, this would be the kind of thing that we would need, you know, if we wanted to address questions, like, you know, what does it take for a machine to be conscious, right? Or when are, you know, when should we regard AIs as being conscious? So now this IIT, this integrated information theory, which has been put forward by Giulio Tinoni and a bunch of his collaborators over the last decade or two, this is noteworthy, I guess, as a direct attempt to answer that question, to, you know, answer the, to address the pretty hard problem, right? And they give a, a criterion that's just based on how a system is connected. So you, so it's up to you to sort of abstract the system, like a brain or a microchip, as a collection of components that are connected to each other by some pattern of connections, you know, and, and to specify how the components can influence each other, you know, like where the inputs go, you know, where they affect the outputs. But then once you've specified that, then they give this quantity that they call phi, you know, the Greek letter phi. And the definition of phi has actually changed over time. It changes from one paper to another, but in all of the variations, it involves something about what we in computer science would call graph expansion. So basically what this means is that they want, in order to get a large value of phi, it should not be possible to take your system and partition it into two components that are only weakly connected to each other. Okay. So whenever we take our system and sort of try to split it up into two, then there should be lots and lots of connections going between the two components. Okay. Well, I understand what that means on a graph. Do they formalize what, how to construct such a graph or data structure, whatever, or is this one of the criticism I've heard you kind of say is that a lot of the very interesting specifics are usually communicated through like natural language, like through words. So it's like the details aren't always clear. Well, it's true. I mean, they have nothing even resembling a derivation of this phi. Okay. So what they do is they state a whole bunch of postulates, you know, axioms that they think that consciousness should satisfy. And then there's some verbal discussion. And then at some point, phi appears. Right. Right. And this, this was what the first thing that really made the hair stand on my neck, to be honest, because they are acting as if there is a derivation. They're acting as if, you know, you're supposed to think that this is a derivation and there's nothing even remotely resembling a derivate. They just pull the phi out of a hat completely. Is one of the key criticisms to you is that details are missing or is there something more fundamental? That's not even the key criticism. That's just, that's just a side point. Okay. The, the core of it is that I think that the, you know, that they want to say that a system is more conscious the larger its value of phi. And I think that that is obvious nonsense. Okay. As soon as you think about it for like a minute, as soon as you think about it in terms of, could I it's like finding out where babies come from. It's like that level of, you know, why didn't anyone tell me this before, right? But I thought, okay, this is just the beginning. Now I know how to write a basic program, but, you know, really write an interesting program, like, you know, a video game, which had always been my dream as a kid to, you know, create my own Nintendo games, right? You know, but, you know, obviously I'm going to need to learn some way more complicated form of programming than that. Okay. But, you know, eventually I learned this incredible idea of universality. And that says that, no, you throw in a few rules and then you already have enough to express everything. Okay. So for example, the AND, the OR and the NOT gate can all, or in fact, even just the AND and the NOT gate, or even just the NAND gate, for example, is already enough to express any Boolean function on any number of bits. You just have to string together enough of them. You can build a universe with NAND gates. You can build the universe out of NAND gates. Yeah. You know, the simple instructions of BASIC are already enough, at least in principle, you know, if we ignore details like how much memory can be accessed and stuff like that, that is enough to express what could be expressed by any programming language whatsoever. And the way to prove that is very simple. We simply need to show that in BASIC or whatever, we could write an interpreter or a compiler for whatever other programming language we care about, like C or Java or whatever. And as soon as we had done that, then ipso facto, anything that's expressible in C or Java is also expressible in BASIC. Okay. And so this idea of universality, you know, goes back at least to Alan Turing in the 1930s when, you know, he wrote down this incredibly simple pared down model of a computer, the Turing machine, right, which, you know, he pared down the instruction set to just read a symbol, you know, write a symbol, move to the left, move to the right, halt, change your internal state, right? That's it. Okay. And anybody proved that, you know, this could simulate all kinds of other things, you know, and so in fact, today we would say, well, we would call it a Turing universal model of computation that is, you know, just as it has just the same expressive power that BASIC or Java or C++ or any of those other languages have because anything in those other languages could be compiled down to Turing machine. Now, Turing also proved a different related thing, which is that there is a single Turing machine that can simulate any other Turing machine if you just describe that other machine on its tape, right? And likewise, there is a single Turing machine that will run any C program, you know, if you just put it on its tape. That's a second meaning of universality. First of all, he couldn't visualize it and that was in the 30s. Yeah, the 30s. That's right. That's before computers really, I mean, I don't know how, I wonder what that felt like, you know, learning that there's no Santa Claus or something. Because I don't know if that's empowering or paralyzing because it doesn't give you any, it's like you can't write a software engineering book and make that the first chapter and say we're done. Well, I mean, right. I mean, in one sense, it was this enormous flattening of the universe. Yes. I had imagined that there was going to be some infinite hierarchy of more and more powerful programming languages, you know, and then I kicked myself for having such a stupid idea. But apparently, G\\u00f6del had had the same conjecture in the 30s. Oh, good. You're in good company. Yeah. And then G\\u00f6del read Turing's paper and he kicked himself and he said, yeah, I was completely wrong about that. But I had thought that maybe where I can contribute will be to invent a new more powerful programming language that lets you express things that could never be expressed in BASIC. And how would you do that? Obviously, you couldn't do it itself in BASIC. But there is this incredible flattening that happens once you learn what is universality. But then it's also an opportunity because it means once you know these rules, then the sky is the limit, right? Then you have kind of the same weapons at your disposal that the world's greatest programmer has. It's now all just a question of how you wield them. Right. Exactly. So every problem is solvable, but some problems are harder than others. Well, yeah, there's the question of how much time, you know, of how hard is it to write a program? And then there's also the questions of what resources does the program need? You know, how much time, how much memory? Those are much more complicated questions. Of course, ones that we're still struggling with today. Exactly. So you've, I don't know if you created Complexity Zoo or... I did create the Complexity Zoo. What is it? What's complexity? Oh, all right, all right, all right. Complexity theory is the study of sort of the inherent resources needed to solve computational problems, okay? So it's easiest to give an example. Like, let's say we want to add two numbers, right? If I want to add them, you know, if the numbers are twice as long, then it only, it will take me twice as long to add them, but only twice as long, right? It's no worse than that. Or a computer. For a computer or for a person. We're using pencil and paper, for that matter. If you have a good algorithm. Yeah, that's right. I mean, even if you just use the elementary school algorithm of just carrying, you know, then it takes time that is linear in the length of the numbers, right? Now, multiplication, if you use the elementary school algorithm, is harder because you have to multiply each digit of the first number by each digit of the second one. And then deal with all the carries. So that's what we call a quadratic time algorithm, right? If the numbers become twice as long, now you need four times as much time, okay? So now, as it turns out, people discovered much faster ways to multiply numbers using computers. And today we know how to multiply two numbers that are n digits long using a number of steps that's nearly linear in n. These are questions you can ask. But now, let's think about a different thing that people, you know, they've encountered in elementary school, factoring a number. Okay? Take a number and find its prime factors, right? And here, you know, if I give you a number with ten digits, I ask you for its prime factors. Well, maybe it's even, so you know that two is a factor. You know, maybe it ends in zero, so you know that ten is a factor, right? But, you know, other than a few obvious things like that, you know, if the prime factors are all very large, then it's not clear how you even get started, right? You know, it seems like you have to do an exhaustive search among an enormous number of factors. Now, and as many people might know, for better or worse, the security, you know, of most of the encryption that we currently use to protect the internet is based on the belief, and this is not a theorem, it's a belief, that factoring is an inherently hard problem for our computers. We do know algorithms that are better than just trial division, than just trying all the possible divisors, but they are still basically exponential. And exponential is hard. Yeah, exactly. So the fastest algorithms that anyone has discovered, at least publicly discovered, you know, I'm assuming that the NSA doesn't know something better, okay? But they take time that basically grows exponentially with the cube root of the size of the number that you're factoring, right? So that cube root, that's the part that takes all the cleverness, okay? But there's still an exponential. There's still an exponentiality there. But what that means is that, like, when people use a thousand bit keys for their cryptography, that can probably be broken using the resources of the NSA or the world's other intelligence agencies. You know, people have done analyses that say, you know, with a few hundred million dollars of computer power, they could totally do this. And if you look at the documents that Snowden released, you know, it looks a lot like they are doing that or something like that. It would kind of be surprising if they weren't, okay? But, you know, if that's true, then in some ways that's reassuring. Because if that's the best that they can do, then that would say that they can't break 2,000 bit numbers, right? Then 2,000 bit numbers would be beyond what even they could do. They haven't found an efficient algorithm. That's where all the worries and the concerns of quantum computing came in, that there could be some kind of shortcut around that. Right. So complexity theory is a huge part of, let's say, the theoretical core of computer science. You know, it started in the 60s and 70s as, you know, sort of an autonomous field. So it was, you know, already, you know, I mean, you know, it was well developed even by the time that I was born, okay? But in 2002, I made a website called the Complexity Zoo, to answer your question, where I just tried to catalog the different complexity classes, which are classes of problems that are solvable with different kinds of resources, okay? So these are kind of, you know, you could think of complexity classes as like being almost to theoretical computer science, like what the elements are to chemistry, right? They're sort of, you know, there are our most basic objects in a certain way. I feel like the elements have a characteristic to them where you can't just add an infinite number. Well, you could, but beyond a certain point, they become unstable, right? Right. So it's like, you know, in theory, you can have atoms with, you know, and look, look, I mean, I mean, a neutron star, you know, is a nucleus with, you know, uncalled billions of neutrons in it, of hadrons in it, okay? But, you know, for sort of normal atoms, right, probably you can't get much above a hundred atomic weight, 150 or so, or sorry, sorry, I mean, beyond 150 or so protons without it, you know, very quickly fissioning. With complexity classes, well, yeah, you can have an infinity of complexity classes, but, you know, maybe there's only a finite number of them that are particularly interesting, right? Just like with anything else, you know, you care about some more than about others. So what kind of interesting classes are there? I mean, you could have just, maybe say, what are the, if you take any kind of computer science class, what are the classes you learn? Good. Let me tell you sort of the biggest ones, the ones that you would learn first. So, you know, first of all, there is P, that's what it's called, okay? It stands for polynomial time. And this is just the class of all of the problems that you could solve with a conventional computer, like your iPhone or your laptop, you know, by a completely deterministic algorithm, right? Using a number of steps that grows only like the size of the input raised to some fixed power, okay? So, if your algorithm is linear time, like, you know, for adding numbers, okay, that problem is in P. If you have an algorithm that's quadratic time, like the elementary school algorithm for multiplying two numbers, that's also in P, even if it was the size of the input to the 10th power or to the 50th power, well, that wouldn't be very good in practice. But, you know, formally, we would still count that, that would still be in P, okay? But if your algorithm takes exponential time, meaning like if every time I add one more data point to your input, if the time needed by the algorithm doubles, if you need time like two to the power of the amount of input data, then that we call an exponential time algorithm, okay? And that is not polynomial, okay? So, P is all of the problems that have some polynomial time algorithm, okay? So, that includes most of what we do with our computers on a day to day basis, you know, all the, you know, sorting, basic arithmetic, you know, whatever is going on in your email reader or in Angry Birds, okay? It's all in P. Then the next super important class is called NP. That stands for non deterministic polynomial, okay? It does not stand for not polynomial, which is a common confusion. But NP was basically all of the problems where if there is a solution, then it is easy to check the solution if someone shows it to you, okay? So, actually a perfect example of a problem in NP is factoring, the one I told you about before. Like if I gave you a number with thousands of digits and I told you that, you know, I asked you, does this have at least three non trivial divisors, right? That might be a super hard problem to solve, right? It might take you millions of years using any algorithm that's known, at least running on our existing computers, okay? But if I simply showed you the divisors, I said, here are three divisors of this number, then it would be very easy for you to ask your computer to just check each one and see if it works. Just divide it in, see if there's any remainder, right? And if they all go in, then you've checked. Well, I guess there were, right? So any problem where, you know, wherever there's a solution, there is a short witness that can be easily, like a polynomial size witness that can be checked in polynomial time, that we call an NP problem, okay? And yeah, so every problem that's in P is also in NP, right? Because, you know, you could always just ignore the witness and just, you know, if a problem is in P, you can just solve it yourself, okay? But now, in some sense, the central, you know, mystery of theoretical computer science is every NP problem in P. So if you can easily check the answer to a computational problem, does that mean that you can also easily find the answer? Even though there's all these problems that appear to be very difficult to find the answer, it's still an open question whether a good answer exists. Because no one has proven that there's no way to do it. It's arguably the most, I don't know, the most famous, the most maybe interesting, maybe you disagree with that, problem in theoretical computer science. So what's your The most famous, for sure. P equals NP. If you were to bet all your money, where do you put your money? That's an easy one. P is not equal to NP. I like to say that if we were physicists, we would have just declared that to be a law of nature, you know, just like thermodynamics. That's hilarious. Given ourselves Nobel Prizes for its discovery. Yeah, you know, and look, if later it turned out that we were wrong, we just give ourselves more Nobel Prizes. So harsh, but so true. I mean, no, I mean, I mean, it's really just because we are mathematicians or descended from mathematicians, you know, we have to call things conjectures that other people would just call empirical facts or discoveries, right? But one shouldn't read more into that difference in language, you know, about the underlying truth. So, okay, so you're a good investor and good spender of money. So then let me ask another way. Is it possible at all? And what would that look like if P indeed equals NP? Well, I do think that it's possible. I mean, in fact, you know, when people really pressed me on my blog for what odds would I put, I put, you know, two or three percent odds. Wow, that's pretty good. That P equals NP. Yeah. Well, because, you know, when P, I mean, you really have to think about, like, if there were 50, you know, mysteries like P versus NP, and if I made a guess about every single one of them, would I expect to be right 50 times? Right? And the truthful answer is no. Okay. Yeah. So, you know, and that's what you really mean in saying that, you know, you have, you know, better than 98% odds for something. Okay. But so, yeah, you know, I mean, there could certainly be surprises. And look, if P equals NP, well, then there would be the further question of, you know, is the algorithm actually efficient in practice? Right? I mean, Don Knuth, who I know that you've interviewed as well, right, he likes to conjecture that P equals NP, but that the algorithm is so inefficient that it doesn't matter anyway. Right? No, I don't know. I've listened to him say that. I don't know whether he says that just because he has an actual reason for thinking it's true or just because it sounds cool. Yeah. Okay. But, you know, that's a logical possibility, right, that the algorithm could be n to the 10,000 time, or it could even just be n squared time, but with a leading constant of, it could be a Google times n squared or something like that. And in that case, the fact that P equals NP, well, it would ravage the whole theory of complexity. We would have to rebuild from the ground up. But in practical terms, it might mean very little, right, if the algorithm was too inefficient to run. If the algorithm could actually be run in practice, like if it had small enough constants, or if you could improve it to where it had small enough constants that was efficient in practice, then that would change the world. Okay? You think it would have, like, what kind of impact would it have? Well, okay, I mean, here's an example. I mean, you could, well, okay, just for starters, you could break basically all of the encryption that people use to protect the internet. That's just for starters. You could break Bitcoin and every other cryptocurrency, or, you know, mine as much Bitcoin as you wanted, right? You know, become a super duper billionaire, right? And then plot your next move. Right. That's just for starters. That's a good point. Now, your next move might be something like, you know, you now have, like, a theoretically optimal way to train any neural network, to find parameters for any neural network, right? So you could now say, like, is there any small neural network that generates the entire content of Wikipedia, right? If, you know, and now the question is not, can you find it? The question has been reduced to, does that exist or not? If it does exist, then the answer would be, yes, you can find it, okay? If you had this algorithm in your hands, okay? You could ask your computer, you know, I mean, P versus NP is one of these seven problems that carries this million dollar prize from the Clay Foundation. You know, if you solve it, you know, and others are the Riemann hypothesis, the Poincare conjecture, which was solved, although the solver turned down the prize, right, and four others. But what I like to say, the way that we can see that P versus NP is the biggest of all of these questions is that if you had this fast algorithm, then you could solve all seven of them, okay? You just ask your computer, you know, is there a short proof of the Riemann hypothesis, right? You know, that a machine could, in a language where a machine could verify it, and provided that such a proof exists, then your computer finds it in a short amount of time without having to do a brute force search, okay? So, I mean, those are the stakes of what we're talking about. But I hope that also helps to give your listeners some intuition of why I and most of my colleagues would put our money on P not equaling NP. Is it possible, I apologize this is a really dumb question, but is it possible to, that a proof will come out that P equals NP, but an algorithm that makes P equals NP is impossible to find? Is that like crazy? Okay, well, if P equals NP, it would mean that there is such an algorithm. That it exists, yeah. But, you know, it would mean that it exists. Now, you know, in practice, normally the way that we would prove anything like that would be by finding the algorithm. But there is such a thing as a nonconstructive proof that an algorithm exists. You know, this has really only reared its head, I think, a few times in the history of our field, right? But, you know, it is theoretically possible that such a thing could happen. But, you know, there are, even here, there are some amusing observations that one could make. So there is this famous observation of Leonid Levin, who was, you know, one of the original discoverers of NP completeness, right? And he said, we'll consider the following algorithm that I guarantee will solve the NP problems efficiently, just as provided that P equals NP, okay? Here is what it does. It just runs, you know, it enumerates every possible algorithm in a gigantic infinite list, right? From like in like alphabetical order, right? You know, and many of them maybe won't even compile, so we just ignore those, okay? But now, we just, you know, run the first algorithm, then we run the second algorithm, we run the first one a little bit more, then we run the first three algorithms for a while, we run the first four for a while. This is called dovetailing, by the way. This is a known trick in theoretical computer science, okay? But we do it in such a way that, you know, whatever is the algorithm out there in our list that solves NP complete, you know, the NP problems efficiently, will eventually hit that one, right? And now, the key is that whenever we hit that one, you know, by assumption, it has to solve the problem, it has to find the solution, and once it claims to find a solution, then we can check that ourselves, right? Because these are NP problems, then we can check it. Now, this is utterly impractical, right? You know, you'd have to do this enormous exhaustive search among all the algorithms, but from a certain theoretical standpoint, that is merely a constant prefactor, right? That's merely a multiplier of your running time. So, there are tricks like that one can do to say that, in some sense, the algorithm would have to be constructive. But, you know, in the human sense, you know, it is possible that to, you know, it's conceivable that one could prove such a thing via a nonconstructive method. Is that likely? I don't think so. Not personally. So, that's P and NP, but the complexity zoo is full of wonderful creatures. Well, it's got about 500 of them. 500. So, how do you get, yeah, how do you get more? I mean, just for starters, there is everything that we could do with a conventional computer with a polynomial amount of memory, okay, but possibly an exponential amount of time, because we get to reuse the same memory over and over again. Okay, that is called P space, okay? And that's actually, we think, an even larger class than NP. Okay, well, P is contained in NP, which is contained in P space. And we think that those containments are strict. And the constraint there is on the memory. The memory has to grow polynomially with the size of the process. That's right. That's right. But in P space, we now have interesting things that were not in NP, like as a famous example, you know, from a given position in chess, you know, does white or black have the win? Let's say, assuming provided that the game lasts only for a reasonable number of moves, okay? Or likewise, for go, okay? And, you know, even for the generalizations of these games to arbitrary size boards, because with an eight by eight board, you could say that's just a constant size problem. You just, you know, in principle, you just solve it in O of one time, right? But so we really mean the generalizations of, you know, games to arbitrary size boards here. Or another thing in P space would be, like, I give you some really hard constraint satisfaction problem, like, you know, a traveling salesperson or, you know, packing boxes into the trunk of your car or something like that. And I ask, not just is there a solution, which would be an NP problem, but I ask how many solutions are there, okay? That, you know, count the number of valid solutions. That actually gives, those problems lie in a complexity class called sharp P, or like, it looks like hashtag, like hashtag P, okay, which sits between NP and P space. There's all the problems that you can do in exponential time, okay? That's called exp. So, and by the way, it was proven in the 60s that exp is larger than P, okay? So we know that much. We know that there are problems that are solvable in exponential time that are not solvable in polynomial time, okay? In fact, we even know, we know that there are problems that are solvable in n cubed time that are not solvable in n squared time. And that, those don't help us with a controversy between P and NP at all. Unfortunately, it seems not, or certainly not yet, right? The techniques that we use to establish those things, they're very, very related to how Turing proved the unsolvability of the halting problem, but they seem to break down when we're comparing two different resources, like time versus space, or like, you know, P versus NP, okay? But, you know, I mean, there's what you can do with a randomized algorithm, right? That can be done with a random algorithm, right? That can sometimes, you know, has some probability of making a mistake. That's called BPP, bounded error probabilistic polynomial time. And then, of course, there's one that's very close to my own heart, what you can efficiently do in polynomial time using a quantum computer, okay? And that's called BQP, right? And so, you know, what's understood about it? Okay, so P is contained in BPP, which is contained in BQP, which is contained in P space, okay? So anything you can, in fact, in something very similar to sharp P. BQP is basically, you know, well, it's contained in like P with the magic power to solve sharp P problems, okay? Why is BQP contained in P space? Oh, that's an excellent question. So there is, well, I mean, one has to prove that, okay? But the proof, you could think of it as using Richard Feynman's picture of quantum mechanics, which is that you can always, you know, we haven't really talked about quantum mechanics in this conversation. We did in our previous one. Yeah, we did last time. But yeah, we did last time, okay? But basically, you could always think of a quantum computation as like a branching tree of possibilities where each possible path that you could take through, you know, the space has a complex number attached to it called an amplitude, okay? And now the rule is, you know, when you make a measurement at the end, well, you see a random answer, okay? But quantum mechanics is all about calculating the probability that you're going to see one potential answer versus another one, right? And the rule for calculating the probability that you'll see some answer is that you have to add up the amplitudes for all of the paths that could have led to that answer. And then, you know, that's a complex number, so that, you know, how could that be a probability? Then you take the squared absolute value of the result. That gives you a number between zero and one, okay? So yeah, I just summarized quantum mechanics in like 30 seconds, okay? But now, you know, what this already tells us is that anything I can do with a quantum computer, I could simulate with a classical computer if I only have exponentially more time, okay? And why is that? Because if I have exponential time, I could just write down this entire branching tree and just explicitly calculate each of these amplitudes, right? You know, that will be very inefficient, but it will work, right? It's enough to show that quantum computers could not solve the halting problem or, you know, they could never do anything that is literally uncomputable in Turing's sense, okay? But now, as I said, there's even a stronger result which says that BQP is contained in PSPACE. The way that we prove that is that we say, if all I want is to calculate the probability of some particular output happening, you know, which is all I need to simulate a quantum computer, really, then I don't need to write down the entire quantum state, which is an exponentially large object. All I need to do is just calculate what is the amplitude for that final state. And to do that, I just have to sum up all the amplitudes that lead to that state. Okay, so that's an exponentially large sum, but I can calculate it just reusing the same memory over and over for each term in the sum. And hence the p, in the PSPACE? Hence the PSPACE. Yeah. So what, out of that whole complexity zoo, and it could be BQP, what do you find is the most, the class that captured your heart the most, the most beautiful class that's just, yeah. I used, as my email address, bqpqpoly at gmail.com. Yes, because BQP slash Qpoly, well, you know, amazingly no one had taken it. Amazing, amazing. But, you know, this is a class that I was involved in sort of defining, proving the first theorems about in 2003 or so. So it was kind of close to my heart. But this is like, if we extended BQP, which is the class of everything we can do efficiently with a quantum computer, to allow quantum advice, which means imagine that you had some special initial state, okay, that could somehow help you do computation. And maybe such a state would be exponentially hard to prepare, okay, but maybe somehow these states were formed in the Big Bang or something, and they've just been sitting around ever since, right? If you found one, and if this state could be like ultra power, there are no limits on how powerful it could be, except that this state doesn't know in advance which input you've got, right? It only knows the size of your input. You know, and that's BQP slash Qpoly. So that's one that I just personally happen to love, okay? But, you know, if you're asking like what's the, you know, there's a class that I think is way more beautiful or fundamental than a lot of people even within this field realize that it is. That class is called SZK, or Statistical Zero Knowledge. And, you know, there's a very, very easy way to define this class, which is to say, suppose that I have two algorithms that each sample from probability distributions, right? So each one just outputs random samples according to, you know, possibly different distributions. And now the question I ask is, you know, let's say distributions over strings of n bits, you know, so over an exponentially large space. Now I ask, are these two distributions close or far as close or far as probability distributions? Okay. Any problem that can be reduced to that, you know, that can be put into that form is an SZK problem. And the way that this class was originally discovered was completely different from that and was kind of more complicated. It was discovered as the class of all of the problems that have a certain kind of what's called zero knowledge proof. Zero knowledge proofs are one of the central ideas in cryptography. You know, Shafi Goldwasser and Silvio McCauley won the Turing Award for, you know, inventing them. And they're at the core of even some cryptocurrencies that, you know, people use nowadays. But zero knowledge proofs are ways of proving to someone that something is true, like, you know, that there is a solution to this, you know, optimization problem or that these two graphs are isomorphic to each other or something, but without revealing why it's true, without revealing anything about why it's true. Okay. SZK is all of the problems for which there is such a proof that doesn't rely on any cryptography. Okay. And if you wonder, like, how could such a thing possibly exist, right? Well, like, imagine that I had two graphs and I wanted to convince you that these two graphs are not isomorphic, meaning, you know, I cannot permute one of them so that it's the same as the other one, right? You know, that might be a very hard statement to prove, right? I might need, you know, you might have to do a very exhaustive enumeration of, you know, all the different permutations before you were convinced that it was true. But what if there were some all knowing wizard that said to you, look, I'll tell you what, just pick one of the graphs randomly, then randomly permute it, then send it to me and I will tell you which graph you started with. Okay. And I will do that every single time. Right. And let's say that that wizard did that a hundred times and it was right every time. Yeah. Right. Now, if the graphs were isomorphic, then, you know, it would have been flipping a coin each time, right? It would have had only a one and two to the 100 power chance of, you know, of guessing right each time. But, you know, so, so if it's right every time, then now you're statistically convinced that these graphs are not isomorphic, even though you've learned nothing new about why they aren't. So fascinating. So yeah. So, so SDK is all of the problems that have protocols like that one, but it has this beautiful other characterization. It's shown up again and again in my, in my own work and, you know, a lot of people's work. And I think that it really is one of the most fundamental classes. It's just that people didn't realize that when it was first discovered. So we're living in the middle of a pandemic currently. Yeah. How has your life been changed or no better to ask, like, how has your perspective of the world change with this world changing event of a pandemic overtaking the entire world? Yeah. Well, I mean, I mean, all of our lives have changed, you know, like, I guess, as with no other event since I was born, you know, you would have to go back to world war II for something, I think of this magnitude, you know, on, you know, the way that we live our lives as for how it has changed my worldview. I think that the, the failure of institutions, you know, like, like, like the CDC, like, you know, other institutions that we sort of thought were, were trustworthy, like a lot of the media was staggering, was, was absolutely breathtaking. It is something that I would not have predicted. Right. I think I, I wrote on my blog that, you know, the, you know, it's, it's, it's fascinating to like rewatch the movie Contagion from a decade ago, right. That correctly foresaw so many aspects of, you know, what was going on, you know, an airborne, you know, virus originates in China, spreads to, you know, much of the world, you know, shuts everything down until a vaccine can be developed. You know, everyone has to stay at home, you know, you know, it gets, you know, an enormous number of things, right. Okay. But the one thing that they could not imagine, you know, is that like in this movie, everyone from the government is like hyper competent, hyper, you know, dedicated to the public good, right. And you know, yeah, they're the, they're the best of the best, you know, they could, you know, and, and there are these conspiracy theorists, right. Who think, you know, you know, this is all fake news. There's no, there's not really a pandemic. And those are some random people on the internet who the hyper competent government people have to, you know, oppose, right. They, you know, in, in trying to envision the worst thing that could happen, like, you know, the, the, there was a failure of imagination. The movie makers did not imagine that the conspiracy theorists and the, you know, and the incompetence and the nutcases would have captured our institutions and be the ones actually running things. So you had a certain, I love competence in all walks of life. I love, I get so much energy. I'm so excited by people who do amazing job. And I like you, or maybe you can clarify, but I had maybe not intuition, but I hope that government at its best could be ultra competent. What, first of all, two questions, like how do you explain the lack of confidence and the other, maybe on the positive side, how can we build a more competent government? Well, there's an election in two months. I mean, you have a faith that the election, I, you know, it's not going to fix everything, but you know, it's like, I feel like there is a ship that is sinking and you could at least stop the sinking. But, you know, I think that there are much, much deeper problems. I mean, I think that, you know, it is plausible to me that, you know, a lot of the failures, you know, with the CDC, with some of the other health agencies, even, you know, predate Trump, you know, predate the, you know, right wing populism that has sort of taken over much of the world now. And, you know, I think that, you know, it is, you know, it is very, I'm actually, you know, I've actually been strongly in favor of, you know, rushing vaccines of, you know, I thought that we could have done, you know, human challenge trials, you know, which were not done, right? We could have, you know, like had, you know, volunteers, you know, to actually, you know, be, you know, get vaccines, get, you know, exposed to COVID. So innovative ways of accelerating what we've done previously over a long time. I thought that, you know, each month that a vaccine is closer is like trillions of dollars. Are you surprised? And of course, lives, you know, at least, you know, hundreds of thousands of lives. Are you surprised that it's taking this long? We still don't have a plan. There's still not a feeling like anyone is actually doing anything in terms of alleviating, like any kind of plan. So there's a bunch of stuff, there's vaccine, but you could also do a testing infrastructure where everybody's tested nonstop with contact tracing, all that kind of. Well, I mean, I'm as surprised as almost everyone else. I mean, this is a historic failure. It is one of the biggest failures in the 240 year history of the United States, right? And we should be, you know, crystal clear about that. And, you know, one thing that I think has been missing, you know, even from the more competent side is like, you know, is sort of the World War II mentality, right? The, you know, the mentality of, you know, let's just, you know, you know, if we can, by breaking a whole bunch of rules, you know, get a vaccine and, you know, and even half the amount of time as we thought, then let's just do that because, you know, like we have to weigh all of the moral qualms that we have about doing that against the moral qualms of not doing. And one key little aspect to that that's deeply important to me, and we'll go into that topic next, is the World War II mentality wasn't just about, you know, breaking all the rules to get the job done. There was a togetherness to it. So I would, if I were president right now, it seems quite elementary to unite the country because we're facing a crisis. It's easy to make the virus the enemy. And it's very surprising to me that the division has increased as opposed to decrease. That's heartbreaking. Yeah. Well, look, I mean, it's been said by others that this is the first time in the country's history that we have a president who does not even pretend to, you know, want to unite the country. I mean, Lincoln, who fought a civil war, said he wanted to unite the country. And I do worry enormously about what happens if the results of this election are contested. And will there be violence as a result of that? And will we have a clear path of succession? And, you know, look, I mean, you know, this is all we're going to find out the answers to this in two months. And if none of that happens, maybe I'll look foolish. But I am willing to go on the record and say, I am terrified about that. Yeah, I've been reading The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich. So if I can, this is like one little voice just to put out there that I think November will be a really critical month for people to breathe and put love out there. Do not, you know, anger in those in that context, no matter who wins, no matter what is said, will destroy our country, may destroy our country, may destroy the world because of the power of the country. So it's really important to be patient, loving, empathetic. Like one of the things that troubles me is that even people on the left are unable to have a love and respect for people who voted for Trump. They can't imagine that there's good people that could vote for the opposite side. Oh, I know there are because I know some of them, right? I mean, you know, it's still, you know, maybe it baffles me, but, you know, I know such people. Let me ask you this. It's also heartbreaking to me on the topic of cancel culture. So in the machine learning community, I've seen it a little bit that there's aggressive attacking of people who are trying to have a nuanced conversation about things. And it's troubling because it feels like nuanced conversation is the only way to talk about difficult topics. And when there's a thought police and speech police on any nuanced conversation that everybody has to like in a animal farm chant that racism is bad and sexism is bad, which is things that everybody believes and they can't possibly say anything nuanced. It feels like it goes against any kind of progress from my kind of shallow perspective. But you've written a little bit about cancel culture. Do you have thoughts there? Well, I mean, to say that I am opposed to, you know, this trend of cancellations or of shouting people down rather than engaging them, that would be a massive understatement, right? And I feel like, you know, I have put my money where my mouth is, you know, not as much as some people have, but, you know, I've tried to do something. I mean, I have defended, you know, some unpopular people and unpopular, you know, ideas on my blog. I've, you know, tried to defend, you know, norms of open discourse, of, you know, reasoning with our opponents, even when I've been shouted down for that on social media, you know, called a racist, called a sexist, all of those things. And which, by the way, I should say, you know, I would be perfectly happy to, you know, if we had time to say, you know, you know, 10,000 times, you know, my hatred of racism, of sexism, of homophobia, right? But what I don't want to do is to cede to some particular political faction the right to define exactly what is meant by those terms to say, well, then you have to agree with all of these other extremely contentious positions or else you are a misogynist or else you are a racist, right? I say that, well, no, you know, don't I or, you know, don't people like me also get a say in the discussion about, you know, what is racism, about what is going to be the most effective to combat racism, right? And, you know, this cancellation mentality, I think, is spectacularly ineffective at its own professed gall of, you know, combating racism and sexism. What's a positive way out? So I, I try to, I don't know if you see what I do on Twitter, but I, on Twitter, I mostly, in my whole, in my life, I've actually, it's who I am to the core is like, I really focus on the positive and I try to put love out there in the world. And still, I get attacked. And I look at that and I wonder like, You too? I didn't know. Like, I haven't actually said anything difficult and nuanced. You talk about somebody like Steven Pinker, who I'm actually don't know the full range of things that he's attacked for, but he tries to say difficult. He tries to be thoughtful about difficult topics. He does. And obviously he just gets slaughtered by. Well, I mean, yes, but it's also amazing how well Steve has withstood it. I mean, he just survived that attempt to cancel him just a couple of months ago, right? Psychologically, he survives it too, which worries me because I don't think I can. Yeah, I've gotten to know Steve a bit. He is incredibly unperturbed by this stuff. And I admire that and I envy it. I wish that I could be like that. I mean, my impulse when I'm getting attacked is I just want to engage every single like anonymous person on Twitter and Reddit who is saying mean stuff about me. And I want to just say, well, look, can we just talk this over for an hour? And then you'll see that I'm not that bad. And sometimes that even works. The problem is then there's the 20,000 other ones. That's not, but psychologically, does that wear on you? It does. It does. But yeah, I mean, in terms of what is the solution, I mean, I wish I knew, right? And so in a certain way, these problems are maybe harder than P versus NP, right? I mean, but I think that part of it has to be that I think that there's a lot of sort of silent support for what I'll call the open discourse side, the reasonable enlightenment side. And I think that that support has to become less silent, right? I think that a lot of people just sort of agree that a lot of these cancellations and attacks are ridiculous, but are just afraid to say so, right? Or else they'll get shouted down as well, right? That's just the standard witch hunt dynamic, which, of course, this faction understands and exploits to its great advantage. But more people just said, we're not going to stand for this, right? This is, guess what? We're against racism too. But what you're doing is ridiculous, right? And the hard part is it takes a lot of mental energy. It takes a lot of time. Even if you feel like you're not going to be canceled or you're staying on the safe side, it takes a lot of time to phrase things in exactly the right way and to respond to everything people say. So, but I think that the more people speak up from all political persuasions, from all walks of life, then the easier it is to move forward. Since we've been talking about love, can you, last time I talked to you about meaning of life a little bit, but here has, it's a weird question to ask a computer scientist, but has love for other human beings, for things, for the world around you played an important role in your life? Have you, it's easy for a world class computer scientist, you could even call yourself like a physicist, everything to be lost in the books. Is the connection to other humans, love for other humans played an important role? I love my kids. I love my wife. I love my parents. I'm probably not different from most people in loving their families and in that being very important in my life. Now, I should remind you that I am a theoretical computer scientist. If you're looking for deep insight about the nature of love, you're probably looking in the wrong place to ask me, but sure, it's been important. But is there something from a computer science perspective to be said about love? Is that even beyond into the realm of consciousness? There was this great cartoon, I think it was one of the classic XKCDs where it shows a heart and it's squaring the heart, taking the four year transform of the heart, integrating the heart, each thing and then it says my normal approach is useless here. I'm so glad I asked this question. I think there's no better way to end this. I hope we get a chance to talk again. This has been an amazing, cool experiment to do it outside. I'm really glad you made it out. Yeah. Well, I appreciate it a lot. It's been a pleasure and I'm glad you were able to come out to Austin. Thanks.

And now let me leave you with some words from Scott Aaronson that I also gave to you in the introduction, which is, if you always win, then you're probably doing something wrong. Thank you for listening and for putting up with the intro and outro in this strange room in the middle of nowhere. And I very much hope to see you next time in many more ways than one. construct a system that had an enormous value of phi, like, you know, even larger than the brain has, but that is just implementing an error correcting code, you know, doing nothing that we would associate with, you know, intelligence or consciousness or any of it. The answer is yes, it is easy to do that. Right. And so I wrote blog posts, just making this point that, yeah, it's easy to do that. Now, you know, Tinoni's response to that was actually kind of incredible, right? I mean, I, I, I admired it in a way because instead of disputing any of it, he just bit the bullet in the sense, you know, he was one of the, the, uh, the most, uh, uh, audacious bullet bitings I've ever seen in my career. Okay. He said, okay, then fine. You know, this system that just applies this error correcting code it's conscious, you know, and if it has a much larger value of phi than you or me, it's much more conscious than you and me. You know, you, we just have to accept what the theory says because, you know, science is not about confirming our intuitions. It's about challenging them. And, you know, this is what my theory predicts that this thing is conscious and, you know, or super duper conscious. And how are you going to prove me wrong? So the way I would argue against your blog posts is I would say, yes, sure. You're right in general, but for naturally arising systems developed through the process of evolution on earth, the, this rule of the larger fee being associated, being associated with more consciousness is correct. Yeah. So that's not what he said at all. Right. Right. Because he wants this to be completely general. So we can apply to even computers. Yeah. I mean, I mean, the, the whole interest of the theory is the, you know, the hope that it could be completely general apply to aliens, to computers, to animals, coma patients, to any of it. Right. And so, so, so he just said, well, you know, Scott is relying on his intuition, but, you know, I'm relying on this theory and, you know, to me it was almost like, you know, are we being serious here? Like, like, like, you know, like, like, okay, yes, in science we try to learn highly nonintuitive things, but what we do is we first test the theory on cases where we already know the answer. Right. Like if we, if someone had a new theory of temperature, right, then, you know, maybe we could check that it says that boiling water is hotter than ice. And then if it says that the sun is hotter than anything, you know, you've ever experienced, then maybe we, we trust that extrapolation. Right. But like this, this theory, like if, if, you know, it's now saying that, you know, a, a gigantic grit, like regular grid of exclusive or gates can be way more conscious than, you know, a person or than, than any animal can be, you know, even if it, you know, is, you know, is, is, is, is so uniform that it might as well just be a blank wall. Right. And, and so now the point is if, if this theory is sort of getting wrong, the question is a blank wall, you know, more conscious than a person, then I would say, what is, what is there for it to get right? So your, your sense is a blank wall is not more conscious than a human being. Yeah. I mean, I mean, I mean, you could say that I am taking that as one of my axioms. I'm saying, I'm saying that if, if a theory of consciousness is, is getting that wrong, then whatever it is talking about at that point, I, I, I'm not going to call it consciousness. I'm going to use a different word. You have to use a different word. I mean, it's also, it's possible just like with intelligence that us humans conveniently define these very difficult to understand concepts in a very human centric way. Just like the Turing test really seems to define intelligence as a thing that's human like. Right. But I would say that with any, uh, concept, you know, there's, uh, uh, uh, you know, like we, we, we, we first need to define it. Right. And a definition is only a good definition if it matches what we thought we were talking about prior to having a definition. Right. And I would say that, you know, uh, fee as a definition of consciousness fails that test. That is my argument. So, okay. So let's take a further step. So you mentioned that the universe might be a Turing machine. So like it might be computations or simulatable by one anyway, simulated by one. So what's your sense about consciousness? Do you think consciousness is computation that we don't need to go to any place outside of the computable universe to, uh, you know, to, to understand consciousness, to build consciousness, to measure consciousness, all those kinds of things? I don't know. These are what, uh, you know, have been called the, the vertiginous questions, right? There's the questions like, like, uh, you know, you get a feeling of vertigo and thinking about them. Right. I mean, I certainly feel like, uh, I am conscious in a way that is not reducible to computation, but why should you believe me? Right. I mean, and, and, and if you said the same to me, then why should I believe you? But as computer scientists, I feel like a computer could be, could achieve human level intelligence, but, and that's actually a feeling and a hope. That's not a scientific belief. It's just, we've built up enough intuition, the same kind of intuition you use in your blog. You know, that's what scientists do. They, I mean, some of it is a scientific method, but some of it is just damn good intuition. I don't have a good intuition about consciousness. Yeah. I'm not sure that anyone does or has in the, you know, 2,500 years that these things have been discussed, Lex. But do you think we will? Like one of the, I've gotten a chance to attend, can't wait to hear your opinion on this, but attend the Neuralink event. And, uh, one of the dreams there is to, uh, you know, basically push neuroscience forward. And the hope with neuroscience is that, uh, we can inspect the machinery from which all this fun stuff emerges and see, we're going to notice something special, some special sauce from which something like consciousness or cognition emerges. Yeah. Well, it's clear that we've learned an enormous amount about neuroscience. We've learned an enormous amount about computation, you know, about machine learning, about AI, how to get it to work. We've learned, uh, an enormous amount about the underpinnings of the physical world, you know, and, you know, from one point of view, that's like, uh, an enormous distance that we've traveled along the road to understanding consciousness. From another point of view, you know, the distance still to be traveled on the road, you know, maybe seems no shorter than it was at the beginning. Right? So it's very hard to say. I mean, you know, these are questions like, like in, in, in sort of trying to have a theory of consciousness, there's sort of a problem where it feels like it's not just that we don't know how to make progress. It's that it's hard to specify what could even count as progress, right? Because no matter what scientific theory someone proposed, someone else could come along and say, well, you've just talked about the mechanism. You haven't said anything about what breathes fire into the mechanism, what really makes there something that it's like to be it. Right. And that seems like an objection that you could always raise no matter, you know, how much someone elucidated the details of how the brain works. Okay. Let's go to the Turing test and the Lobner Prize. I have this intuition, call me crazy, but we, that a machine to pass the Turing test and it's full, whatever the spirit of it is, we can talk about how to formulate the perfect Turing test, that that machine has to be conscious. We at least have to, I have a very low bar of what consciousness is. I tend to, I tend to think that the emulation of consciousness is as good as consciousness. So the consciousness is just a dance, a social, a social, a shortcut, like a nice, useful tool, but I tend to connect intelligence consciousness together. So by, by that, do you, maybe just to ask what, what role does consciousness play? Do you think it passed in the Turing test? Well, look, I mean, it's almost tautologically true that if we had a machine that passed the Turing test, then it would be emulating consciousness. Right? So if your position is that, you know, emulation of consciousness is consciousness, then so, you know, by, by definition, any machine that passed the Turing test would be conscious. But it's, but I mean, we know that you could say that, you know, that, that is just a way to rephrase the original question, you know, is an emulation of consciousness, you know, necessarily conscious. Right. And you can, can, you know, I hear, I'm not saying anything new that hasn't been debated ad nauseum in the literature. Okay. But, you know, you could imagine some very hard cases, like imagine a machine that passed the Turing test, but that did so just by an enormous cosmological sized lookup table that just cashed every possible conversation that could be had. The old Chinese room. Well, well, yeah, yeah. But, but this is, I mean, I mean, the Chinese room actually would be doing some computation, at least in Searle's version. Right. Here, I'm just talking about a table lookup. Okay. Now it's true that for conversations of a reasonable length, this, you know, lookup table would be so enormous that wouldn't even fit in the observable universe. Okay. But supposing that you could build a big enough lookup table and then just, you know, pass the Turing test just by looking up what the person said. Right. Are you going to regard that as conscious? Okay. Let me try to make this formal and then you can shut it down. I think that the emulation of something is that something, if there exists in that system, a black box that's full of mystery. So like, full of mystery to whom? To human specters. So does that mean that consciousness is relative to the observer? Like, could something be conscious for us, but not conscious for an alien that understood better what was happening inside the black box? Yes. So that if inside the black box is just a lookup table, the alien that saw that would say this is not conscious. To us, another way to phrase the black box is layers of abstraction, which make it very difficult to see to the actually underlying functionality of the system. And then we observe just the abstraction. And so it looks like magic to us. But once we understand the inner machinery, it stops being magic. And so like, that's a prerequisite is that you can't know how it works, or some part of it, because then there has to be in our human mind, entry point for the magic. So that's a formal definition of the system. Yeah, well, look, I mean, I explored a view in this essay I wrote called The Ghost in the Quantum Touring Machine seven years ago that is related to that, except that I did not want to have consciousness be relative to the observer, right? Because I think that if consciousness means anything, it is something that is experienced by the entity that is conscious, right? Like, I don't need you to tell me that I'm conscious, nor do you need me to tell you that you are, right? But basically, what I explored there is are there aspects of a system like a brain that just could not be predicted even with arbitrarily advanced future technologies? It's because of chaos combined with quantum mechanical uncertainty and things like that. I mean, that actually could be a property of the brain, you know, if true, that would distinguish it in a principled way, at least from any currently existing computer. Not from any possible computer, but yeah, yeah. This is a thought experiment. So if I gave you information that the entire history of your life, basically explain away free will with a lookup table, say that this was all predetermined, that everything you experienced has already been predetermined, wouldn't that take away your consciousness? Wouldn't you, yourself, wouldn't the experience of the world change for you in a way that you can't take back? Well, let me put it this way. If you could do like in a Greek tragedy where, you know, you would just write down a prediction for what I'm going to do and then maybe you put the prediction in a sealed box and maybe, you know, you open it later and you show that you knew everything I was going to do or, you know, of course, the even creepier version would be you tell me the prediction and then I try to falsify it, my very effort to falsify it makes it come true, right? Let's even forget that, you know, that version as convenient as it is for fiction writers, right? Let's just do the version where you put the prediction into a sealed envelope, okay? But if you could reliably predict everything that I was going to do, I'm not sure that that would destroy my sense of being conscious, but I think it really would destroy my sense of having free will, you know, and much, much more than any philosophical conversation could possibly do that, right? And so I think it becomes extremely interesting to ask, you know, could such predictions be done, you know, even in principle, is it consistent with the laws of physics to make such predictions, to get enough data about someone that you could actually generate such predictions without having to kill them in the process to, you know, slice their brain up into little slivers or something. I mean, it's theoretically possible, right? Well, I don't know. I mean, it might be possible, but only at the cost of destroying the person, right? I mean, it depends on how low you have to go in sort of the substrate. Like if there was a nice digital abstraction layer, if you could think of each neuron as a kind of transistor computing a digital function, then you could imagine some nanorobots that would go in and would just scan the state of each transistor, you know, of each neuron and then, you know, make a good enough copy, right? But if it was actually important to get down to the molecular or the atomic level, then, you know, eventually you would be up against quantum effects. You would be up against the unclonability of quantum states. So I think it's a question of how good of a replica, how good does the replica have to be before you're going to count it as actually a copy of you or as being able to predict your actions. That's a totally open question. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And especially once we say that, well, look, maybe there's no way to, you know, to make a deterministic prediction because, you know, we know that there's noise buffeting the brain around, presumably even quantum mechanical uncertainty, you know, affecting the sodium ion channels, for example, whether they open or they close. You know, there's no reason why over a certain time scale that shouldn't be amplified, just like we imagine happens with the weather or with any other, you know, chaotic system. So if that stuff is important, right, then we would say, well, you know, you can't, you know, you're never going to be able to make an accurate enough copy. But now the hard part is, well, what if someone can make a copy that sort of no one else can tell apart from you, right? It says the same kinds of things that you would have said, maybe not exactly the same things because we agree that there's noise, but it says the same kinds of things. And maybe you alone would say, no, I know that that's not me, you know, it's, it doesn't share my, I haven't felt my consciousness leap over to that other thing. I still feel it localized in this version, right? And then why should anyone else believe you? What are your thoughts? I'd be curious, you're a really good person to ask, which is Penrose's, Roger Penrose's work on consciousness, saying that there, you know, there is some, there's some, with axons and so on, there might be some biological places where quantum mechanics can come into play and through that create consciousness somehow. Yeah. Okay. Well, um, uh, of course, you know, I read Penrose's books as a teenager. They had a huge impact on me. Uh, uh, five or six years ago, I had the privilege to actually talk these things over with Penrose, you know, at some length at a conference in Minnesota. And, uh, you know, he is, uh, uh, you know, an amazing, uh, personality. I admire the fact that he was even raising such, uh, audacious questions at all. Uh, but you know, to, to, to answer your question, I think the first thing we need to get clear on is that he is not merely saying that quantum mechanics is relevant to consciousness, right? That would be like, um, you know, that would be tame compared to what he is saying, right? He is saying that, you know, even quantum mechanics is not good enough, right? If, because if, if supposing for example, that the brain were a quantum computer, I know that's still a computer, you know, in fact, a quantum computer can be simulated by an ordinary computer. It might merely need exponentially more time in order to do so, right? So that's simply not good enough for him. Okay. So what he wants is for the brain to be a quantum gravitational computer or, or, uh, uh, he wants the brain to be exploiting as yet unknown laws of quantum gravity. Okay. Which would, which would be uncomputable. That's the key point. Okay. Yes. Yes. That would be literally uncomputable. And I've asked him, you know, to clarify this, but uncomputable, even if you had an Oracle for the halting problem or, you know, and, and, or, you know, as high up as you want to go and the sort of high, the usual hierarchy of uncomputability, he wants to go beyond all of that. Okay. So, so, you know, just, just to be clear, like, you know, if we're keeping count of how many speculations, you know, there's probably like at least five or six of them, right? There's first of all, that there is some quantum gravity theory that would involve this kind of uncomputability, right? Most people who study quantum gravity would not agree with that. They would say that what we've learned, you know, what little we know about quantum gravity from the, this ADS CFT correspondence, for example, has been very much consistent with the broad idea of nature being computable, right? But, but all right, but, but supposing that he's right about that, then, you know, what most physicists would say is that whatever new phenomena there are in quantum gravity, you know, they might be relevant at the singularities of black holes. They might be relevant at the big bang. They are plainly not relevant to something like the brain, you know, that is operating at ordinary temperatures, you know, with ordinary chemistry and, you know, the, the, the physics underlying the brain, they, they would say that we have, you know, the fundamental physics of the brain, they would say that we've pretty much completely known for, for generations now, right? Because, you know, quantum field theory lets us sort of parameterize our ignorance, right? I mean, Sean Carroll has made this case and, you know, in great detail, right? That sort of whatever new effects are coming from quantum gravity, you know, they are sort of screened off by quantum field theory, right? And this is, this brings, you know, brings us to the whole idea of effective theories, right? But the, like we have, you know, the, in like in the standard model of elementary particles, right? We have a quantum field theory that seems totally adequate for all of the terrestrial phenomena, right? The only things that it doesn't, you know, explain are, well, first of all, you know, the details of gravity, if you were to probe it, like at, at, you know, extremes of, you know, curvature or like incredibly small distances, it doesn't explain dark matter. It doesn't explain black hole singularities, right? But these are all very exotic things, very, you know, far removed from our life on earth, right? So for Penrose to be right, he needs, you know, these phenomena to somehow affect the brain. He needs the brain to contain antennae that are sensitive to this as yet unknown physics, right? And then he needs a modification of quantum mechanics, okay? So he needs quantum mechanics to actually be wrong, okay? He needs, what he wants is what he calls an objective reduction mechanism or an objective collapse. So this is the idea that once quantum states get large enough, then they somehow spontaneously collapse, right? That, you know, and this is an idea that lots of people have explored. You know, there's something called the GRW proposal that tries to, you know, say something along those lines, you know, and these are theories that actually make testable predictions, right? Which is a nice feature that they have. But, you know, the very fact that they're testable may mean that in the, you know, in the coming decades, we may well be able to test these theories and show that they're wrong, right? You know, we may be able to test some of Penrose's ideas. If not, not his ideas about consciousness, but at least his ideas about an objective collapse of quantum states, right? And people have actually, like Dick Balmeister, have actually been working to try to do these experiments. They haven't been able to do it yet to test Penrose's proposal, okay? But Penrose would need more than just an objective collapse of quantum states, which would already be the biggest development in physics for a century since quantum mechanics itself, okay? He would need for consciousness to somehow be able to influence the direction of the collapse so that it wouldn't be completely random, but that, you know, your dispositions would somehow influence the quantum state to collapse more likely this way or that way, okay? Finally, Penrose, you know, says that all of this has to be true because of an argument that he makes based on G\\u00f6del's incompleteness theorem, okay? Now, like I would say the overwhelming majority of computer scientists and mathematicians who have thought about this, I don't think that G\\u00f6del's incompleteness theorem can do what he needs it to do here, right? I don't think that that argument is sound, okay? But that is, you know, that is sort of the tower that you have to ascend to if you're going to go where Penrose goes. And the intuition he uses with the incompleteness theorem is that basically that there's important stuff that's not computable? Is that where he takes it? It's not just that because, I mean, everyone agrees that there are problems that are uncomputable, right? That's a mathematical theorem, right? But what Penrose wants to say is that, you know, for example, there are statements, you know, given any formal system, you know, for doing math, right? There will be true statements of arithmetic that that formal system, you know, if it's adequate for math at all, if it's consistent and so on, will not be able to prove. A famous example being the statement that that system itself is consistent, right? No, you know, good formal system can actually prove its own consistency. That can only be done from a stronger formal system, which then can't prove its own consistency and so on forever, okay? That's G\\u00f6del's theorem. But now, why is that relevant to consciousness, right? Well, you know, I mean, the idea that it might have something to do with consciousness as an old one, G\\u00f6del himself apparently thought that it did. You know, Lucas thought so, I think, in the 60s. And Penrose is really just, you know, sort of updating what they and others had said. I mean, you know, the idea that G\\u00f6del's theorem could have something to do with consciousness was, you know, in 1950, when Alan Turing wrote his article about the Turing test, he already, you know, was writing about that as like an old and well known idea and as a wrong one that he wanted to dispense with. Okay, but the basic problem with this idea is, you know, Penrose wants to say that and all of his predecessors here, you know, want to say that, you know, even though, you know, this given formal system cannot prove its own consistency, we as humans sort of looking at it from the outside can just somehow see its consistency, right? And the, you know, the rejoinder to that, you know, from the very beginning has been, well, can we really? I mean, maybe, you know, maybe he, Penrose can, but, you know, can the rest of us, right? And, you know, I noticed that, you know, I mean, it is perfectly plausible to imagine a computer that could say, you know, it would not be limited to working within a single formal system, right? They could say, I am now going to adopt the hypothesis that my formal system is consistent, right? And I'm now going to see what can be done from that stronger vantage point and so on. And, you know, and I'm going to add new axioms to my system. Totally plausible. There's absolutely, G\\u00f6del's theorem has nothing to say about against an AI that could repeatedly add new axioms. All it says is that there is no absolute guarantee that when the AI adds new axioms that it will always be right. Okay. And, you know, and that's, of course, the point that Penrose pounces on, but the reply is obvious. And, you know, it's one that Alan Turing made 70 years ago. Namely, we don't have an absolute guarantee that we're right when we add a new axiom. We never have, and plausibly we never will. So on Alan Turing, you took part in the Lubna Prize? Not really. No, I didn't. I mean, there was this kind of ridiculous claim that was made some almost a decade ago about a chat bot called Eugene Goostman. I guess you didn't participate as a judge in the Lubna Prize. I didn't. But you participated as a judge in that, I guess it was an exhibition event or something like that, or with Eugene... Eugene Goostman, that was just me writing a blog post because some journalist called me to ask about it. Did you ever chat with him? I thought that... I did chat with Eugene Goostman. I mean, it was available on the web. Oh, interesting. I didn't know that. So yeah. So all that happened was that a bunch of journalists started writing breathless articles about a first chat bot that passes the Turing test. And it was this thing called Eugene Goostman that was supposed to simulate a 13 year old boy. And apparently someone had done some test where people were less than perfect, let's say, distinguishing it from a human. And they said, well, if you look at Turing's paper and you look at the percentages that he talked about, then it seemed like we're past that threshold. And I had a different way to look at it instead of the legalistic way, like let's just try the actual thing out and let's see what it can do with questions like, is Mount Everest bigger than a shoebox? Or just like the most obvious questions. And the answer is, well, it just kind of parries you because it doesn't know what you're talking about. So just to clarify exactly in which way they're obvious. They're obvious in the sense that you convert the sentences into the meaning of the objects they represent and then do some basic obvious common sense reasoning with the objects that the sentences represent. Right. It was not able to answer or even intelligently respond to basic common sense questions. But let me say something stronger than that. There was a famous chatbot in the 60s called Eliza that managed to actually fool a lot of people. Or people would pour their hearts out into this Eliza because it simulated a therapist. And most of what it would do is it would just throw back at you whatever you said. And this turned out to be incredibly effective. Maybe therapists know this. This is one of their tricks. But it really had some people convinced. But this thing was just like, I think it was literally just a few hundred lines of Lisp code. It was not only was it not intelligent, it wasn't especially sophisticated. It was like a simple little hobbyist program. And Eugene Goostman, from what I could see, was not a significant advance compared to Eliza. And that was really the point I was making. In some sense, you didn't need a computer science professor to sort of say this. Anyone who was looking at it and who just had an ounce of sense could have said the same thing. But because these journalists were calling me, the first thing I said was, well, I'm a quantum computing person. I'm not an AI person. You shouldn't ask me. Then they said, look, you can go here and you can try it out. I said, all right. All right. So I'll try it out. This whole discussion, it got a whole lot more interesting in just the last few months. Yeah. I'd love to hear your thoughts about GPT3. In the last few months, the world has now seen a chat engine or a text engine, I should say, called GPT3. I think it still does not pass a Turing test. There are no real claims that it passes the Turing test. This comes out of the group at OpenAI, and they've been relatively careful in what they've claimed about the system. But I think as clearly as Eugene Goostman was not in advance over Eliza, it is equally clear that this is a major advance over Eliza or really over anything that the world has seen before. This is a text engine that can come up with kind of on topic, reasonable sounding completions to just about anything that you ask. You can ask it to write a poem about topic X in the style of poet Y and it will have a go at that. And it will do not a great job, not an amazing job, but a passable job. Definitely as good as, in many cases, I would say better than I would have done. You can ask it to write an essay, like a student essay, about pretty much any topic and it will get something that I am pretty sure would get at least a B minus in the most high school or even college classes. And in some sense, the way that it did this, the way that it achieves this, Scott Alexander of the much mourned blog, Slate Star Codex, had a wonderful way of putting it. He said that they basically just ground up the entire internet into a slurry. And to tell you the truth, I had wondered for a while why nobody had tried that. Why not write a chat bot by just doing deep learning over a corpus consisting of the entire web? And so now they finally have done that. And the results are very impressive. It's not clear that people can argue about whether this is truly a step toward general AI or not, but this is an amazing capability that we didn't have a few years ago. A few years ago, if you had told me that we would have it now, that would have surprised me. And I think that anyone who denies that is just not engaging with what's there. So their model, it takes a large part of the internet and compresses it in a small number of parameters relative to the size of the internet and is able to, without fine tuning, do a basic kind of a querying mechanism, just like you described where you specify a kind of poet and then you want to write a poem. And it somehow is able to do basically a lookup on the internet of relevant things. How else do you explain it? Well, okay. The training involved massive amounts of data from the internet and actually took lots and lots of computer power, lots of electricity. There are some very prosaic reasons why this wasn't done earlier. But it costs some tens of millions of dollars, I think. Less, but approximately like a few million dollars. Oh, okay. Oh, really? Okay. It's more like four or five. Oh, all right. All right. Thank you. I mean, as they scale it up, it will... It'll cost, but then the hope is cost comes down and all that kind of stuff. But basically, it is a neural net or what's now called a deep net, but they're basically the same thing. So it's a form of algorithm that people have known about for decades. But it is constantly trying to solve the problem, predict the next word. So it's just trying to predict what comes next. It's not trying to decide what it should say, what ought to be true. It's trying to predict what someone who had said all of the words up to the preceding one would say next. Although to push back on that, that's how it's trained. That's right. No, of course. It's arguable that our very cognition could be a mechanism as that simple. Oh, of course. Of course. I never said that it wasn't. Right. But... Yeah. I mean, and sometimes that is... If there is a deep philosophical question that's raised by GPT3, then that is it, right? Are we doing anything other than this predictive processing, just trying to constantly trying to fill in a blank of what would come next after what we just said up to this point? Is that what I'm doing right now? It's impossible. So the intuition that a lot of people have, well, look, this thing is not going to be able to reason, the Mountain Everest question. Do you think it's possible that GPT5, 6, and 7 would be able to, with this exact same process, begin to do something that looks like... Is indistinguishable to us humans from reasoning? I mean, the truth is that we don't really know what the limits are, right? Right. Exactly. Because what we've seen so far is that GPT3 was basically the same thing as GPT2, but just with a much larger network, more training time, bigger training corpus, right? And it was very noticeably better than its immediate predecessor. So we don't know where you hit the ceiling here, right? I mean, that's the amazing part and maybe also the scary part, right? Now, my guess would be that at some point, there has to be diminishing returns. It can't be that simple, can it? Right? But I wish that I had more to base that guess on. Right. Yeah. I mean, some people say that there will be a limitation on the... We're going to hit a limit on the amount of data that's on the internet. Yes. Yeah. So sure. So there's certainly that limit. I mean, there's also... If you are looking for questions that will stump GPT3, you can come up with some without... Even getting it to learn how to balance parentheses, right? It doesn't do such a great job, right? And its failures are ironic, right? Like basic arithmetic, right? And you think, isn't that what computers are supposed to be best at? Isn't that where computers already had us beat a century ago? Right? And yet that's where GPT3 struggles, right? But it's amazing that it's almost like a young child in that way, right? But somehow, because it is just trying to predict what comes next, it doesn't know when it should stop doing that and start doing something very different, like some more exact logical reasoning, right? And so one is naturally led to guess that our brain sort of has some element of predictive processing, but that it's coupled to other mechanisms, right? That it's coupled to, first of all, visual reasoning, which GPT3 also doesn't have any of, right? Although there's some demonstration that there's a lot of promise there using... Oh yeah, it can complete images. That's right. And using exact same kind of transformer mechanisms to like watch videos on YouTube. And so the same self supervised mechanism to be able to look, it'd be fascinating to think what kind of completions you could do. Oh yeah, no, absolutely. Although like if we ask it to like, you know, a word problem that involve reasoning about the locations of things in space, I don't think it does such a great job on those, right? To take an example. And so the guess would be, well, you know, humans have a lot of predictive processing, a lot of just filling in the blanks, but we also have these other mechanisms that we can couple to, or that we can sort of call as subroutines when we need to. And that maybe, you know, to go further, that one would want to integrate other forms of reasoning. Let me go on another topic that is amazing, which is complexity. And then start with the most absurdly romantic question of what's the most beautiful idea in computer science or theoretical computer science to you? Like what just early on in your life, or in general, have captivated you and just grabbed you? I think I'm going to have to go with the idea of universality. You know, if you're really asking for the most beautiful. I mean, so universality is the idea that, you know, you put together a few simple operations, like in the case of Boolean logic, that might be the AND gate, the OR gate, the NOT gate, right? And then your first guess is, okay, this is a good start, but obviously, as I want to do more complicated things, I'm going to need more complicated building blocks to express that, right? And that was actually my guess when I first learned what programming was. I mean, when I was, you know, an adolescent and someone showed me Apple basic, and then, you know, GW basic, if anyone listening remembers that. Okay. But, you know, I thought, okay, well, now, you know, I mean, I thought I felt like this is a revelation.

I mean, it's fascinating because it's a subjective experience. It's deeply tied to our emotions, our thoughts, our behaviors. It's very personal and individual, but it's also universal. It's something that everyone experiences in some form or another. So, I think there's a lot to explore about the science of love and how it intersects with our understanding of consciousness, emotions, and social interactions. So, yeah, I mean, I think there's a lot to ponder and discover about the mysteries of love, even from a computer science perspective. But again, it's a complex and multi-dimensional topic that goes beyond the realms of algorithms and complexity classes. But I think it's a topic worth delving into with an open mind and a curious spirit.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"text_tokenized\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"summary_tokenized\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

      "Original text: day endurance wise that's okay yeah i think that's fine like you will have free days as well so i don't think that will be a problem and also you have to prepare two sets of openings for each day which makes it more difficult for the teams preparing which i think is also good let me ask you a fun question if hikaru nakamura was one of the two people i guess i apologize yeah he could have finished second so he lost the last round of the candidates yeah and maybe you can explain to me internet speed copium is something you tweeted yeah but if he got second would you just despite him still play the world championship that's internet question and when the internet asks i must abide the dude abides yeah sure thank you internet so after the last match i did an interview right after where i talked about the fact that i was unlikely to play the next one i'd spoken privately to both family friends and of course also my chess team that this was likely going to be the last match what happened was that right before the world championship match there was this young player alireza firouzsa he had a dramatic rise he rose to second in the world rankings he was 18 then he's 19 now he qualified for the candidates and it felt like there was like at least a half realistic possibility that he could be the challenger for the next world championship and that sort of lit a fire under me do you like that idea yeah i like that a lot i love the idea of playing him in the next world championship and originally i was sure that i wanted to announce right after the tournament the match that this was it i'm done i'm not playing the next one but this lit a fire under me so that made me think this actually motivates me and i just wanted to get it out there for several reasons to create more hype about the candidates to sort of motivate myself a little bit maybe motivate him also obviously i wanted to give people a heads up for the candidates that you might be playing for more than first place normally the candidates is first place or best it's like the world championship and then so nakamura was one of many people who just didn't believe me which is fair because i've talked before about not necessarily wanting to defend again but i never talked as concretely or was as serious as this time so he simply didn't believe me and he was very vocal about that and he said nobody believed me no other players which may or may not have been true and then yeah he lost the last game and he didn't qualify but to answer the question no i'd already at that point decided that i wouldn't play i would have liked it less if he had not lost the last round but the decision was already made does it break your heart a little bit that you're walking away from it in all the ways that you mentioned that it's just not fun there's a bunch of ways that it doesn't seem to bring out the best kind of chess it doesn't bring out the best out of you in the particular opponents involved does it just break your heart a little bit like you're walking away from something or maybe the entire chess community is walking away from a kind of a historic event that was so important in the 20th century at least so i won the championship in 2013 i said no to the candidates in 2011 i didn't particularly like the format i also wasn't i was just not in the mood i didn't want the pressure that was connected with the world championship and i was perfectly content at the time to play the tournaments that i did play also to be ranked number one in the world i was comfortable with the fact that i knew that i was the best and i didn't need a title to show others and what happened later is i suddenly decided to play in 2013 they changed the format i liked it better i just decided it could be interesting let's try and get this there really wasn't more than that to it it wasn't like fulfilling lifelong dream or anything i just thought let's play so it's just a cool tournament a good challenge yeah it's a cool tournament it's a good challenge why not it's something that could be a motivation it motivated me to get in the best shape of my life that i had been until then so it was a good thing and 2013 match brought me a lot of joy as well so i'm very very happy that i did that but i never had any thoughts that i'm going to keep the title for a long time immediately after the match in 2013 also before the match i'd spoken against the fact that the champion is seeded into the final which i thought was unfair after the match i made a proposal that we have a different system where the champion doesn't have these privileges and people's reaction both players and chess community was generally like ok we're good we don't want that you keep your privileges and i was like ok whatever so you want to fight for it every time yeah i want that i have to ask just in case you have an opinion if you can maybe from a fantasy chess perspective analyze ding versus nepo who wins the current the two people that would play if you're not playing generally i would consider that ding has a slightly better overall chess strength what are the strengths and weaknesses of each if you can summarize it \n",

      "Original text: win every battle you only need to win the battles that count and the battles that count are in the world championship finals that's the one that counts think about that win that's the one you're going to be remembered for you're not going to be remembered for the battle you lost on tuesday afternoon at 3 pm in some nameless gym with some guy that no one cares about no one's going to remember that you're going to be remembered for your peak performances not your everyday performances focus your everyday performances on skill development so that your peak performances you can focus on winning this is not a therapy session but if i could just speak every session's a therapy session there is still an ape thing in there of course you think i don't feel it you think everyone in the room doesn't feel it because for example you have never seen me roll when there's people i've seen the look in people's eyes when they see me train and i could see maybe it's me projecting but they think i thought you were supposed to be good i thought you were supposed to be a black belt that look they're like studying i'm going to give you some therapy ok do you know how many people have come up to me over the years who have visited the training halls that i work in and they come up to me and they go man i rolled with gary tonin i did really well with him like really well i'm like oh that's very good very impressive and then i see them talking to their friends like man i tapped out gary tonin and i'm sitting there going yeah and you can see that they're just like whoa dude i'm way better than i thought i was gary tonin all of my students i push them in the direction of giving up bad positions so that they practice working getting out of critical situations it's a huge part of our training program but gary tonin takes that to a level that just no one else even gets close it's just amazing he will put himself in impossible situations where it's a fully locked strangle 100 on with both his arms behind his back and he'll try to work out from there and seven times out of 10 he does but three times out of 10 he gets caught i'm a huge advocate of handicap training where you handicap yourself to work on skills he's took that to heart to a level that few people i believe can match i just wonder what his psychology is like because there's it goes back to what we talked about before lex you have to understand it's skill development don't take it personally i understand i hear where you're coming from we've all got what you call the ape reflex where we want to be dominant ok we all do because there's thousands of white belts out there that have tapped gary tonan and they're walking around and they're posting online i tapped gary tonan gary tonan's one of the best in the world so i'm one of the best in the world and does gary get upset about this no of course not because gary knows that when it counts on stage he's going to be going 100 with a set of skills that very few people can match he can go into an ebi overtime at the 205 pound weight division against an adcc champion starting in a full arm lock position and effortlessly get out with no problems in seconds because he's been in that situation 25 000 times with varying degrees of skilled opponents and there's just no panic no fear he's just doing what he's done so many thousands of times and that's a fine fine example of a guy who didn't give a damn what happened in the training room but when it counted on the stage in front of the cameras it kicked in yeah he's an incredible inspiration actually he's a practitioner of something you've recently talked quite a bit about which is the power of escaping sort of bad positions i think you've talked about it which is really interesting framing is escaping bad positions is one of the best ways if not the best way to demonstrate dominance psychologically over your opponent that anything they throw at you like their weapons are useless against you there's a little bit of lex friedman kicking through on this question your obsession with dominance is skewing your point of view it's a therapy session it's a therapy session i'm coming from a wrestling perspective i think it's not just lex friedman i think it's dan gable i think it's dominant the gary tonin ethic it just goes against everything wrestling is about you never put yourself in a bad position and the fact it's a philosophically i don't know what to do with it it's a total reframing of showing dominance by escaping any bad position yeah let's talk about the idea of what is the value of escapes why do i put this in as the first skill that every jiu jitsu student must master believe it or not when i talked about how it pertains to dominance that's its smallest value its greatest value has nothing to do with dominance it has to do with confidence you can train someone and teach them technique until you're blue in the face but at some point the athlete in question has to go out there on the stage and pull the trigger when the time is right what's going to give you that ability to go from the physical skills that you've learned to execution under pressure is confidence i always talk about skill development and yes skill development is the absolute bedrock of my training programs but you can't finish at that level \n",

      "Original text: objective no it's completely an objective measure it's an objective measure of the opinions of everybody else now is that physics i don't know tell me something you think is actually objective and measurable in a way that makes sense cameras they don't you're getting me off on something here but do you know that cameras which are just reflecting light and putting them on film did not work for dark skin people until the 1970s you know why because you were building cameras for the people who were going to buy cameras who all at least in the united states and western europe were relatively light skin turns out it took terrible pictures of people who look like me that got fixed with better film and whole processes do you know why because furniture manufacturers wanted to be able to take pictures of mahogany furniture right because candy manufacturers wanted to be able to take pictures of chocolate now the reason i bring that up is because you might think that cameras are objective they're just capturing light no they're doing the things that they're doing based upon decisions by real human beings to privilege if i may use that word some physics over others because it's an engineering problem there are tradeoffs right so i can either worry about this part of the spectrum or this part of the spectrum this costs more that costs less this costs the same but i have more people paying money over here right and it turns out that if a giant conglomerate demands that you do something different and it's going to involve all kinds of money for you suddenly the tradeoffs change right and so there you go i actually don't know how i ended up there oh it's because of this notion of objectiveness right so even the objective isn't objective because at the end you've got to tell a story you've got to make decisions you've got to make tradeoff what else is engineering other than that so i think that the rankings capture something they just don't necessarily capture what people assume they capture you know just to linger on this idea why is there not more people who just like play with whatever that narrative is have fun with it have like excite the world whether it's in the carl sagan style of like that calm sexy voice of explaining the stars and all the romantic stuff or the elon musk dare i even say donald trump where you're like trolling and shaking up the system and just saying controversial things i talked to lisa feldman barrett who's a neuroscientist who just enjoys playing the controversy things like finds the counter intuitive ideas in the particular science and throws them out there and sees how they play in the public discourse like why don't we see more of that and why doesn't academia attract an elon musk type well tenure is a powerful thing that allows you to do whatever you want but getting tenure typically requires you to be relatively narrow right because people are judging you well i think the answer is we have told ourselves a story a narrative that is vulgar what you just described is vulgar it's certainly unscientific right and it is easy to convince yourself that in some ways you're the mathematician right the fewer there are in your major the more that proves your purity right so once you tell yourself that story then it is beneath you to do that kind of thing right i think that's wrong i think that and by the way everyone doesn't have to do this everyone's not good at it and everyone even if they would be good at it would enjoy it so it's fine but i do think you need some diversity in the way that people choose to relate to the world as academics because i think the great universities are ones that engage with the rest of the world it is a home for public intellectuals and in 2020 being a public intellectual probably means being on twitter whereas of course that wasn't true 20 years ago because twitter wasn't around 20 years ago and if it was it wasn't around in a meaningful way i don't actually know how long twitter has been around as i get older i find that my notion of time has gotten worse and worse like google really has been around that long anyway the point is that i think that we sometimes forget that a part of our job is to impact the people who aren't in the world that we're in and that that's the point of being at a great place and being a great person frankly there's an interesting force in terms of public intellectuals forget twitter we could look at just online courses that are public facing in some part there is a kind of force that pulls you back let me just call it out because i don't give a damn at this point there's a little bit of all of us have this but certainly faculty have this which is jealousy whoever's popular at being a good communicator exciting the world with their science and of course when you excite the world with the science it's not peer reviewed clean it all sounds like bullshit it's like a ted talk and people roll their eyes and they hate that a ted talk gets millions of views or something like that and then everybody pulls each other back there's this force that just kind of it's hard to stand out unless you win a nobel prize or whatever it's only when you get senior enough where you just stop giving a damn but just like you said even when you get tenure that was always the surprising thing to me i have many colleagues and friends who have gotten tenure but there's not a switch \n",

      "Original text: a suit as a ceo tweets about dogecoin but like an actual job he's low level engineering and that to me was always inspiring to see somebody who knows what the fuck they're doing that's what it like he gains the respect of engineers at the lowest level i don't know if that's scalable but that's always been inspiring to me and i wonder how many people it's inspiring to maybe you could speak to the value of doing that of no matter how high your level of leader is to be able to do the low level shit yeah and that's a common trait that good leaders have and maybe he doesn't necessarily know how to do everything a good leader but they go down there and talk to the frontline troops and say hey what is the issue that you're dealing with or you know how can i support you how can i give you help and one key point that you said is he said when there's a problem he gets in there so there's things happening at his companies that they're working and so he doesn't have to die i'm not saying he never does but he doesn't have to spend as much time working on or looking at some subsystem that's functioning well he's got a good leader in there that's handling it and he checks in with that leader and the leader says yeah it's working perfectly he says great when there's a problem that's when he might have to get down there and dig into some details so that he fully understands it so that he when he digs down in the details and this is important he's coming from an altitude where he has a better bigger perspective not necessarily better but a bigger perspective so if you sit there and work on a problem whatever for eight hours and you're staring at you know if you were planning a mission and you were planning it for eight hours you're staring at the maps and the charts and you're figuring out where all the troops are going to be located and i come in after eight hours and i look at your plan from a distant perspective there's a good chance i'll be able to see holes in your plan that you couldn't see because your perspective was too close so that's good for me to be able to come in from a higher perspective and have a look at it but also there's times where i need to get down there and actually look you know if you're looking at a problem and you say look i can't figure out boss i can't figure out how to get to this target and i'm looking at it from a distance and i don't see i might need to start digging in and looking and saying oh here's a route that we can take that actually makes sense let's try that so i think it's a good example of someone going up and down in altitude to look at problems understanding what's happening with the frontline troops and at the same time being able to go back to the strategic level and i can it's probably this way the reason that he's successful is because he doesn't get stuck down there yeah because if he felt the need to micromanage each and every part on a tesla it wouldn't be it would be very unlikely that he would have the capacity to do that it wouldn't be it would be very unlikely that he would have the capacity to do all that now he can hand over some broad chip design and say hey this is what the function needs to be and he gives it to lex and lex goes there with your team and you figured out and you make it happen if he had to actually do that all himself most likely not possible so that's what leaders should be doing they should go elevate and and and then get down in the weeds when they have to and then go back up the sad thing this is the part that makes me not want to do a startup is basically his whole life is dealing with emergencies just like you said he's not dealing this is not shooting the shit about details of engineering it's dealing with like in this in the case of the company life and death like something that can just completely damage the production line right so he's constantly dealing with emergencies putting out fires and i don't know if there's something to be said about that psychology of that of how like he he's spoken himself that he's worried whether his mind can hold up much longer so hopefully in the near future he will start to form more decentralized command where he has some subordinate leadership that he fully trusts and most important that he has properly trained so that they can handle these day to day fires at least 80 of them so only 20 of the time does he actually need to go in and solve a problem if he's not doing that right now then that's going to end up being a problem anytime so i work with companies all the time and that's what's interesting about this is i go and work with a ceo or with a with a c suite of a company it takes a little while to figure out what's going on i'm kind of going off of the things that you're telling me almost anecdotally right yes but let's say that what you and also i don't know how familiar you actually are with the inner workings of his companies but if we were to assume that what you're saying is accurate then my advice would be hey listen you need to start putting a little bit more time and effort into training up \n",

      "Original text: job to resist against it so it's a test i love the idea that if you're going to be creative and innovative you don't have enough up against you yeah exactly this is exactly it it's not hard enough already that i want to be an author now you got to be like well let me just put some fire ants on top of it so i just want to separate i agree with you that the cynicism is bad and destructive but the idea that life is suffering and thinking from that as a first principle i think there's a lot of beauty to be discovered through that so there's a cynicism and then there's a horrible message life is suffering well yeah i mean camus camus doesn't think that now we're going into definitions of suffering then because absurd life is absurd and life is suffering are not even close to the same concept well then you're just defining the terms differently well that's because they're different terms well so is love and beauty but let's define terms you're selling if your baby's in the crib like with a fever and you're like oh that's absurd no it's the kids suffering it's not the same so yes starvation you've been for the white pill researching a lot of actual specifically defined suffering sure but also a lot of wonderful things right yeah but the word suffering can encompass more than just specifically starving and it can encompass like a lot of the philosophers talk about it it encompass like philosophical suffering the fact that if you're not careful life can appear meaningless you can fall into a nihilistic view it's difficult to have the responsibility of freedom to act in this world because you can fuck up in so many different ways and then life is seemingly unfair in the sense that good things happen for no apparent reason and terrible things happen for no apparent reason like you know it's the old religious question of why does evil happen in the world why do terrible things happen in the world there's this book called six word memoirs right where all these different personalities those are awesome were you in it no i'm in it with so you had to basically write your autobiography in six words six words and mine was good things happen to bad people you see there you go there's humor yes that's your way of dealing with the suffering but i don't think life is inherent if life was suffering we wouldn't be able to have happiness no out of suffering happiness is born so like it's the ups and downs of life and what it means like i don't agree at all that you need to suffer in order to be happy i agree you have to work hard but that's not the same thing yeah all right so the way i'm using suffering and i think a lot of them use suffering is the way you use like gravity so in order for the roller coaster to work you need gravity there needs to be a force that bring you down sure in that same way there's like you have to resist the natural pull of nature that wants to destroy you no nature wants you to nature isn't different but we have the capacity because we're blessed with minds and we're blessed with friends yeah to transcend nature yeah i know but i think it's a word that captures something about life that there's no reason to it that is absurd i think to me oftentimes the way i think about the word suffering is synonymous with absurdity this is not suffering but this is absurd i just noticed there's a box with a big bow on it next to you what's in the box michael it's your present so it's your present for new year's can we open it yeah sure what's in the box and you brought up suffering this is going to be very unpleasant here you go i packed it myself yeah there's a whole process in there so there's three presents in there lex i'll read the card first okay something about opening presents like tearing stuff makes me feel like because like i just tore the sheet of paper so it'll never be the same again it's entropy it's entropy time is you've got a powerful voice you've got a powerful voice to lex thank you maybe i should read the other card first you've got a powerful voice listening to what you have to say always puts me in a hopeful place i feel like this is building up to something you show me how change can happen when you face the world with pride confidence and a voice that can't be silenced keep speaking up the world is listening yeah there's no cynicism in this card no this is about this is new year's this is all about hope and joy love to lex i'm seeing the binary to lex thank you for setting the path for me to move to austin 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 michael malice yeah brings tears to my eyes thank you brother my pleasure let's get to the present okay it's a pc box this is very promising it better not be sex toys i swear to god there's nothing inappropriate at all why would it why would sex toys be inappropriate that's sex positive because you're a virgin you gotta bring a knife to a party how clever is it to put it in a pc box well i had it i just got a new pc okay get this also canned get this also canned yeah open the can first open the can do you wrap this yourself that scared the shit out of me \n",

mean that's the it's not for mars to me today right now ai is to eyes on earth all of our space data compiling that using supercomputers because we have so much information and knowledge and we need to get that into people's hands first there's the educational issue with climate and our changing climate then we need to change human behavior that's the biggie so this next decade it's urgent we take care of our own spaceship which is spaceship earth so that's to me where my focus has been for ai systems using whatever's out there kind of imagining also what the future situation is what's the satellite imagery of earth of the future if you can hold that in your hands that's gonna be really powerful will that help people accelerate positive change for earth and for us to live in balance with earth i hope so and kind of start with the ocean systems so oceans to land to air and kind of using all the space data so it's a huge role for artificial intelligence to help us analyze i call it curating the data using the data it has a lot to do with visualizations as well do you think in a weird dark question do you think human species can survive if we don't become interplanetary in the next century or a couple of centuries absolutely we can survive i don't think mars is option b actually so i think it's all about saving spaceship earth and humanity i simply put earth doesn't need us but we really need earth all of humanity needs to live in balance with earth because earth has been here a long time before we ever showed up and it'll be here a long time after it's just a matter of how do we wanna live with all living beings much more in balance because we need to take care of the earth and right now we're not so that's the urgency and i think it is the next decade to try to live much more sustainably live more in balance with earth i think the human species has a great long optimistic future but we have to act it's urgent we have to change behavior we have to realize that we're all in this together it's just one blue bubble it's for humanity so when i think people realize that we're all astronauts that's the great news is everyone's gonna be an astronaut we're all astronauts of spaceship earth and again this is our mission this is our mission to take care of the planet and yet as we explore out from our spaceship earth here out into the space what do you think the next 50 100 200 years look like for space exploration i'm optimistic so i think that we'll have lots of people thousands of people tens of thousands of people who knows maybe millions in low earth orbit that's just a place that we're gonna have people and actually some industry manufacturing things like that that dream i hope we realize getting people to the moon so i can envision a lot of people on the moon again it's a great place to go living or visiting probably visiting and living if you want to most people are gonna wanna come back to earth i think but there'll be some people and it's not such a long it's a good view it's a beautiful view so i think that we will have many people on the moon as well i think there'll be some people you told me wow hundreds of years out so we'll have people we'll be interplanetary for sure as a species so i think we'll be on the moon i think we'll be on mars venus no it's already a runaway greenhouse gas so not a great place for science jupiter all within the solar system great place for all of our scientific probes i don't see so much in terms of human physical presence we'll be exploring them so we live in our minds there because we're exploring them and going on those journeys but it's really our choice in terms of our decisions of how in balance we're gonna be living here on the earth when do you think the first woman first person will step on mars ah step on mars well i'm gonna do everything i can to make sure it happens in the 2030s 2030s say mid 20 mid 20 2025 2035 we'll be on the moon and hopefully with more people than us but first with a few astronauts it'll be global international folks but we really need those 10 years i think on the moon and then so by later in the decade in the 2030s we'll have all the technology and know how and we need to get that human mission to mars done we live in exciting times and dava thank you so much for leading the way and thank you for talking today i really appreciate it thank you my pleasure thanks for listening to this conversation and thank you to our presenting sponsor cash app remember to use code lexpodcast when you download cash app from the app store or

      "Original text: things and you use that as the bar the measuring stick for what you do during development because what happens that along the route you know this oh we're not gonna be able to get that feature done on time throw that one overboard we gotta hit the we have to hit the date oh we're not sure this product's right yet add another feature add another feature creep right if you don't have that story you know you're gonna tell at the beginning you don't have that bar right and then at the end you don't know when you're done if you don't have that story so you can actually look at that press release you know you change it over time that draft but then when you're done you know the what's and the whys you have all the things the audience and everything and then you can give that to marketing and say well and marketing has been along the way let's be clear but then everybody's in sync and that's when you can tell a cohesive non fictional story about and the product delivers on that story or hopefully over delivers on that story so in the drafting from the beginning to the end of the press release what does a successful team look like who's part of the draft is it engineers designers what's the purpose of a marketing department in a company small let's say small company but more than two people so from where does the why come from should it always come from the designer or should there be a marketing person that yeah steps in and ask the question so i'll just keep asking random questions no these are great questions so cause you're just like i'm like i can't wait to tell you the answer so it's in the book as well but you have to separate out the various functions of marketing that's what i thought i was like marketing's marketing and it's really not there's so many disciplines just like in engineering mechanical electrical software and even software it's cloud services firmware applications marketing has that much diversity as well okay and you have to honor that and so there is marketing communications like pr press there is social marketing there is a marketing creative right there's marketing activation but there's another thing that also comes out and people confuse it with marketing which is called product marketing or product management and product management or product marketing is the voice of the customer they're the person who sits there and listens to what's going on in the competition in the marketplace understanding the needs and those pains of the customer and they're representing them in every single meeting so things don't get off track right so that and they're creating the messages not the marketing what happens is there's messages that product marketing creates like those are the deep messages like we need to save 20 of energy let's say right and then marketing turns that into something that's with creative and everything and brings that message across maybe it doesn't say that but it comes maybe visually or some other way so product management does that and holds that press release along the route and making sure that we're tracking and then also marketing is tracking with that press release to make sure they're not telling a fictional story right because they can also add extra adjectives or something and then the product can't deliver that it's like no no no no no keeps everybody in check it has to be grounded to the press release to the raws right to the customer needs right cause they're always representing the customer so you have to have a product manager typically that's the founder right in the beginning and then over time you hire a product management team to then really watch over this the whole way and they are talking to customer support they're talking to engineering they're talking to design they're talking to sales and marketing and they are always in the mix and it's the hardest thing to hire for ooh yeah so they have this very important job of developing and maintaining the why exactly why is it the hardest to hire for because you have to understand first nobody reports to you you're alone so you're alone and you have to build great ties with all of these different functions you have to understand what they do be empathetic with what they do and you have to project the customer's empathy or empathy for the customer to them and tell them why and why this customer needs this why this doesn't work and so that they learn more they're not just doing but they learn about the customer's point of view and sit in there and stand in their shoes to be able to then make better decisions on the engineering details or the operational details customer support details so they understand that if they're not the customer that it's intended for they start to live through their eyes and see through their eyes of that customer so they make better decisions and there's probably fascinating beautiful tensions between that and sort of the engineers oh that's cool sort of the developing the what exactly which makes it an extra hard job i'm sure exactly can i ask a sort of a little bit of a personal question on the one subfield of marketing you mentioned comms and pr how do i ask this i can hear your struggle in your sigh why or do the comms and pr folks sometimes kill the heart and soul of the magic that makes a company or is that wrong to say give me an example i will say the spirit of the example which is it feels like often the jobs of communications is to provide caution it almost works together with legal to say \n",

      "Original text: because he was trying to write this novel and because he was so brilliant yeah i mean we'll talk about psychedelics and treating in bringing some of trauma to the surface and dealing with all those kinds of things but there's something also to the opening up of creativity for whether it's for writing purposes or for in my world for engineering for invention innovation and invention itself is a very is a deeply creative process and it's fascinating to think with the aid of psychedelics what kind of ideas can be brought to life yeah well we have the whole phenomena of a lot of the people in silicon valley and else microdosing psychedelics in order to have a little touch more of this creative approach to things i would love it to see if it was that's more like terrence mckenna territory correct me if i'm wrong but i would love to sort of more scientific to where there'll be the rigor of saying how to do it effectively how to sort of understand sort of not just almost to take the full journey of creative exploration and to do it for prolonged periods of time for years lifelong kind of part of your life of how it empowers creativity i think of course you start with helping people deal with trauma and then the next step is people who have moved past their trauma and are trying to do something create something special in their life how can then psychedelics empower that yeah now that also just to not shy away from anything controversial that gets us to this idea of psychedelics for vision quest particularly for younger people you know when you're sort of moving into this adulting kind of phase and you have to figure out what are you gonna do with your life there's so many options a lot of people of course feel constrained that they have very few options but i think this idea of psychedelics as a way to help you find your calling or find your vision or find your unique leverage point i think we'll see that more and more as our culture evolves and gets healthier around the use of psychedelics so it's both the science having the rigor of understanding how to do it safely and the culture catching up to the fact that this is both safe and very useful yeah although i would question this idea of safety so we can understand physiological risks and we can minimize them and i think there's very minimal physiological risks from the classic psychedelics virtually none or for even mdma under safe conditions psychological risks are harder to address but we can do that through the sense of safety and support but i think there's a level of risk there that we shouldn't overlook and so to make a drug into a medicine what we have to do is prove to the satisfaction of the fda and other regulatory agencies that things are safe and efficacious but even though they use those words proving safety and safe and efficacious it's in relationship to the disease that you're trying to treat and you accept a certain amount of risk so it's the risk benefit ratio rather than pure safety yeah absolutely let me ask you about ken kesey a little bit longer because fascinating him being he was also part of project mkultra yeah yes what was project mkultra and what lessons we should take away from it well mkultra was a program by the cia what they were looking at was can you take these drugs these psychedelic drugs and weaponize them in different ways for interrogation for true serums for exposing somebody before they give a big talk to something like lsd and then they can't talk or make a fool of themselves or can you spray lsd over the battlefield and have everybody tripping and drop their weapons and then you just walk up and nobody dies and you've won the battle so it's a fascinating concept yeah they call it nonlethal incapacitance and i think that's how it's one way to win a war is to enforce peace to get everybody not caring about the war but yes well i think gandhi said something even better which is that the true way to win a war is to turn your enemy into your friend yes that's a beautiful way to put it yeah but mkultra was really nefarious and it was part of our military and it was done in secret and they would dose people against their will i mean one of the most infamous things was that they had a house of prostitution in san francisco and they would have one way mirrors all this stuff and then they would just dose people with lsd and they would have the prostitutes dose these guys with lsd and observe what they would do and how they would act and the cia actually for a while was dosing each other secretly and that there's a famous case of this fellow olson that either jumped out of a window or was pushed he might've been killed he was a cia guy and they gave him lsd and then they're trying to see can they break him down and get him to tell secrets and i think he felt uncomfortable with what happened to him while he was under the influence of lsd and whether he was pushed or not i don't know if we'll ever know but mkultra was violating people's human rights it was done in secret and the irony of it is that ken kesey is one of the people one of the main early people that got lsd in this context and then he was one of the main people that helped inspire the hippies to use psychedelics to oppose the vietnam war so i think the cia kind of in many cases \n",

      "Original text: respond to the banging of the coffee cups behind me or i'm going to keep focusing that's pure top down control so limbic friction is high in that environment you've put yourself into a high limbic friction environment meaning that the prefrontal cortex has to work really hard but there's another side to limbic friction too which is when you're very sleepy there's nothing incoming it can be completely silent and it's hard to engage and focus because you're drifting off and you're getting sleepy so their limbic friction is high but for the opposite reason autonomic arousal is too low so they're turning on netflix in the background or looping a song might boost your level of alertness that will allow top down control to be in exactly the sweet spot you want it so this is why earlier i was saying it's all about how we feel inside relative to what's going on on the outside we're constantly in this i guess one way you could envision it spatially especially if people are listening to this just on audio is i like to think about it kind of like a glass barbell where one sphere of perception and attention can be on what's going on with me and one sphere of attention can be on what's going on with you or something else in the room or in my environment but this barbell isn't rigid it's not really glass would plasma work here i don't know anything about plasma sorry i don't know so imagine that this thing can contort the size of the globes at the end of this barbell can get bigger or smaller so let's say i close my eyes and i bring all my experience into what's going on through interoception internally now it's as if i've got two orbs of perception just on my internal state but i can also do the opposite and bring both orbs of perception outside me i'm not thinking about my heart rate or my breathing i'm just thinking about something i see and what you'll start to realize as you kind of use this spatial model is that two things one is that it's very dynamic and that the more relaxed we are the more these two orbs of attention the two ends of the barbell can move around freely the more alert we are the more rigid they're going to be tethered in place and that was designed so that if i have a threat in my environment it's tethered to that threat if something's coming to attack me i'm not going to be like oh my breathing cadence is a little bit quick that's not how it works why because both orbs are linked to that threat and so my behavior is now actually being driven by something external even though i think it's internal and so i don't want to get too abstract here because i'm a neuroscientist i'm not a theorist but when you start thinking about models of how the brain works there are only really three things that neurons do they're either sensory neurons they're motor neurons or they're modulating things and the models of attention and perception that we have now 2020 tell us that we've got interoception and exteroception they're strongly modulated by levels of autonomic arousal and that if we want to form the optimal relationship to some task or some pressure or some thing whether or not it's sleep an impending threat or coding we need to adjust our internal space time relationship with the external space time relationship and i realize i'm repeating what i said earlier but we can actually assign circuitry to this stuff it mostly has to do with how much limbic friction there is how much you're being pulled to some source that source could be internal if i have pain physical pain in my body i'm going to be much more interoceptive than i am exteroceptive you could be talking to me and i'm just going to be thinking about that pain it's very hard and the other thing that we can link it to is top down control meaning anything in our environment that has a lot of salience will tend to bring us into more exteroception than interoception and again i don't want to litter the conversation with just a bunch of terms but what i think it can be useful for people is to do what essentially you've done lex is to start developing an awareness when i wake up am i mostly in a mode of interoception or exteroception when i work well what does working well look like from the perspective of autonomic arousal how alert or calm am i what kind of balance between internal focus and external focus is there and to sort of watch this process throughout the day can you linger just briefly on because you use this term a lot and it'd be nice to try to get a little more color to it which is interoception and exteroception what are we exactly talking about so like what's included in each category and how much overlap is there interoception would be an awareness of anything that's within the confines or on the surface of my skin that i'm sensing so literally physiological physiologically like within the boundaries of my skin and probably touched to the skin as well exteroception would be perception of anything that's beyond the reach of my skin so that bottle of water a scent a sound and this can change dramatically actually if you have headphones in you tend to hear things in your head as opposed to a speaker in the room this is actually the basis of ventriloquism so there are beautiful experiments done by greg reckenzone up at uc davis looking at how auditory and visual cues are matched and you have an array of speakers and this will become obvious as i say \n",

      "Original text: maybe a couple of things i want to say one person i think i would like to talk to is ghislaine maxwell i always get afraid right before you reveal these kinds of things and now i know why i get afraid yeah i mean again assuming that she did the things that people claim she did they're despicable right i mean these were underage children right there's just no version of the story where she did the things she was accused of doing and is still a quote unquote good person there's just in my mind right and yet i think there is tremendous interest in understanding like what led her to do all that so at least for some people let me say a couple of things so one is at a high level let me say that she believes or her current story is that she's the victim of who jeffrey epstein oh my i think i'll just leave that there as is so these are ideas that you're facing the nature of truth and the nature of the human mind is what it is and this is imagine folks if you went into a room with a person that says that what do you do next let me also say that i never or rarely let me say not say never i rarely mention names that i'm interested in talking to without having made significant progress in already securing that interview so people sometimes ask me about vladimir zelensky and vladimir putin i do not bring them up lightly in terms of their being a path to an actual conversation that said something i regret but i'm not sure i know what to do with it but in the case of all the people i just mentioned i haven't been preparing for those conversations i only start really preparing seriously when it's confirmed because it's such a heavy burden and one of the things i regret in having mentioned a conversation with vladimir putin before the war in ukraine broke out in the past few years is that i would mention it very loosely very casually and without having really deeply put myself into a place that i'm ready to talk to him and that's a tricky thing because then the internet the audience in general and just me when i listen back to my dumb self think well why are you speaking so lightly about these topics well i know you've had a longstanding interest in talking to him i think now well i don't understand how i would sit down and have a conversation with somebody like that but that's not in the range of my skill sets or like maybe not in the range of things that you're drawn to somehow not so much i mean i would watch that episode with great interest well you did an episode recently with this guy who was a former cyber criminal turned state side right i think he works for the government now and there was a segment in there remind me his name brett johnson brett johnson there was a segment in there where he talked about stealing a lifetime's worth of collected coins from some elderly woman and this was everything she had and then he openly admitted that he felt no remorse which is the way he described is purely sociopathic and then of course we learned that he grew up in a family where criminal behavior was very common it was kind of embedded into his notions of what typical behaviors were and i found myself somewhat conflicted but also hung up on this idea that i mean he had behaved as a sociopath or in a sociopathic way and it created an internal conflict because he's quite charming guest and his stories are terrific especially i really enjoyed his discussions about how he would go out and do all these things out of a desire to please his girlfriend so he was in service to other people despite being sociopathic he could say he was in service to them as a way to extract gets very complicated i think is the reason i went into science is that at some level it's more about facts than it is opinions and judgments and i don't know that i have the ability to suspend judgment away from the kind of top level contours of my initial reaction to like if it's true like the ghislaine maxwell's and the liz holmes and the other sociopaths is one of just kind of revulsion and repulsion but that could also reflect the fact that i'm not as neurologically sophisticated as somebody that can spin all the plates of empathy forgiveness but also holding people accountable at the same time that's work that takes if you think about it that's three four brain circuits having to work in parallel that's the difference between chess or a game of go and a game of checkers i guess i'm playing checkers and you're playing chess no so one is actually holding in your mind and two is the raw skill of conversation you're very just having listened to your interviews you're very good at conversation but the skill of conversation is really tricky i'm not being self deprecating i'm being just objective i'm not good at conversation i'm working very hard getting better at it i'm speaking not about just podcasting i'm speaking just normal life i have anxiety from social interaction i do you really a huge amount yeah yeah so this is interesting because i never detect that in you ever and i think there are people that we both know that have said to me that they too feel anxious and yet your voice is steady i don't see any perspiration oh yeah you appear incredibly calm i'm scared shitless i was scared shitless with rick rubin rick rubin is when you first meet him \n",
