Jordan, a professor at Berkeley and one of the most influential people in the history of machine learning, statistics, and artificial intelligence. He has been cited over 170,000 times and he has mentored many of the world class researchers defining the field of AI today, including Andrew Ng, Zubin Garamani, Ben Taskar, and Yoshua Bengio. All this, to me, is as impressive as the over 32,000 points in the six NBA championships of the Michael J. Jordan of basketball fame. There's a nonzero probability that I talked to the other Michael Jordan given my connection to and love of the Chicago Bulls of the 90s, but if I had to pick one, I'm going with the Michael Jordan of statistics and computer science, or as Yann LeCun calls him, the Miles Davis of machine learning. In his blog post titled Artificial Intelligence, the Revolution Hasn't Happened Yet, Michael argues for broadening the scope of the artificial intelligence field. In many ways, the underlying spirit of this podcast is the same, to see artificial intelligence as a deeply human endeavor, to not only engineer algorithms and robots, but to understand and empower human beings at all levels of abstraction, from the individual to our civilization as a whole. This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast. If you enjoy it, subscribe and YouTube, give it five stars at Apple Podcast, support it on Patreon, or simply connect with me on Twitter at Lex Friedman spelled F R I D M A N. As usual, I'll do one or two minutes of ads now and never any ads in the middle that can break the flow of the conversation. I hope that works for you and doesn't hurt the listening experience. This show is presented by Cash App, the number one finance app in the App Store. When you get it, use code LEX PODCAST. Cash App lets you send money to friends, buy Bitcoin, and invest in the stock market with as little as $1. Since Cash App does fractional share trading, let me mention that the order execution algorithm that worked behind the scenes to create the abstraction of the fractional orders is to me an algorithmic marvel. Great props for the Cash App engineers for solving a hard problem that in the end provides an easy interface that takes a step up to the next layer of abstraction over the stock market, making trading more accessible for new investors and diversification much easier. So once again, if you get Cash App from the App Store or Google Play and use the code LEX PODCAST, you'll get $10 and Cash App will also donate $10 to First, one of my favorite organizations that is helping to advance robotics and STEM education for young people around the world. And now, here's my conversation with Michael I. Jordan. Given that you're one of the greats in the field of AI, machine learning, computer science, and so on, you're trivially called the Michael Jordan of machine learning, although as you know, you were born first, so technically MJ is the Michael I. Jordan of basketball. But anyway, my favorite is Yann LeCun calling you the Miles Davis of machine learning because as he says, you reinvent yourself periodically and sometimes leave fans scratching their heads after you change direction. So can you put at first your historian hat on and give a history of computer science and AI as you saw it, as you experienced it, including the four generations of AI successes that I've seen you talk about? Sure. Yeah, first of all, I much prefer Yann's metaphor. Miles Davis was a real explorer in jazz and he had a coherent story. So I think I have one, but it's not just the one you lived, it's the one you think about later. What the historian does is they look back and they revisit. I think what's happening right now is not AI, that was an intellectual aspiration that's still alive today as an aspiration. But I think this is akin to the development of chemical engineering from chemistry or electrical engineering from electromagnetism. So if you go back to the 30s or 40s, there wasn't yet chemical engineering. There was chemistry, there was fluid flow, there was mechanics and so on. But people pretty clearly viewed interesting goals to try to build factories that make chemicals products and do it viably, safely, make good ones, do it at scale. So people started to try to do that, of course, and some factories worked, some didn't, some were not viable, some exploded, but in parallel, developed a whole field called chemical engineering. Electrical engineering is a field, it's no bones about it, it has theoretical aspects to it, it has practical aspects. It's not just engineering, quote unquote, it's the real thing, real concepts are needed. Same thing with electrical engineering. There was Maxwell's equations, which in some sense were everything you know about electromagnetism, but you needed to figure out how to build circuits, how to build modules, how to put them together, how to bring electricity from one point to another safely and so on and so forth. So a whole field that developed called electrical engineering. I think that's what's happening right now, is that we have a proto field, which is statistics, more of the theoretical side of it, algorithmic side of computer science, that was enough to start to build things, but what things? Systems that bring value to human beings and use human data and mix in human decisions. The engineering side of that is all ad hoc. That's what's emerging. In fact, if you wanna call machine learning a field, I think that's what it is, that it's a proto form of engineering based on statistical and computational ideas of previous generations. But do you think there's something deeper about AI in his dreams and aspirations as compared to chemical engineering and electrical engineering? Well the dreams and aspirations maybe, but those are 500 years from now. I think that that's like the Greeks sitting there and saying, it would be neat to get to the moon someday. I think we have no clue how the brain does computation. We're just a clueless. We're even worse than the Greeks on most anything interesting scientifically of our era. Can you linger on that just for a moment because you stand not completely unique, but a little bit unique in the clarity of that. Can you elaborate your intuition of why we're, like where we stand in our understanding of the human brain? And a lot of people say, you know, scientists say we're not very far in understanding human brain, but you're like, you're saying we're in the dark here. Well, I know I'm not unique. I don't even think in the clarity, but if you talk to real neuroscientists that really study real synapses or real neurons, they agree, they agree. It's a hundreds of year task and they're building it up slowly and surely. What the signal is there is not clear. We think we have all of our metaphors. We think it's electrical, maybe it's chemical, it's a whole soup, it's ions and proteins and it's a cell. And that's even around like a single synapse. If you look at a electron micrograph of a single synapse, it's a city of its own. And that's one little thing on a dendritic tree, which is extremely complicated electrochemical thing. And it's doing these spikes and voltages are flying around and then proteins are taking that and taking it down into the DNA and who knows what. So it is the problem of the next few centuries. It is fantastic. But we have our metaphors about it. Is it an economic device? Is it like the immune system or is it like a layered set of, you know, arithmetic computations? We have all these metaphors and they're fun. But that's not real science per se. There is neuroscience. That's not neuroscience. All right. That's like the Greek speculating about how to get to the moon, fun, right? And I think that I like to say this fairly strongly because I think a lot of young people think we're on the verge because a lot of people who don't talk about it clearly let it be understood that, yes, we kind of, this is a brain inspired, we're kind of close, you know, breakthroughs are on the horizon. And that's scrupulous people sometimes who need money for their labs. That's what I'm saying, scrupulous, but people will oversell, I need money for my lab, I'm studying computational neuroscience, I'm going to oversell it. And so there's been too much of that. So I'll step into the gray area between metaphor and engineering with, I'm not sure if you're familiar with brain computer interfaces. So a company like Elon Musk has Neuralink that's working on putting electrodes into the brain and trying to be able to read, both read and send electrical signals. Just as you said, even the basic mechanism of communication in the brain is not something we understand. But do you hope without understanding the fundamental principles of how the brain works, we'll be able to do something interesting at that gray area of metaphor? It's not my area. So I hope in the sense, like anybody else hopes for some interesting things to happen from research, I would expect more something like Alzheimer's will get figured out from modern neuroscience. There's a lot of human suffering based on brain disease and we throw things like lithium at the brain, it kind of works, no one has a clue why. That's not quite true, but mostly we don't know. And that's even just about the biochemistry of the brain and how it leads to mood swings and so on. How thought emerges from that, we were really, really completely dim. So that you might want to hook up electrodes and try to do some signal processing on that and try to find patterns, fine, by all means, go for it. It's just not scientific at this point. So it's like kind of sitting in a satellite and watching the emissions from a city and trying to infer things about the microeconomy, even though you don't have microeconomic concepts. It's really that kind of thing. And so yes, can you find some signals that do something interesting or useful? Can you control a cursor or mouse with your brain? Yeah, absolutely, and then I can imagine business models based on that and even medical applications of that. But from there to understanding algorithms that allow us to really tie in deeply from the brain to computer, I just, no, I don't agree with Elon Musk. I don't think that's even, that's not for our generations, not even for the century. So just in hopes of getting you to dream, you've mentioned Kolmogorov and Turing might pop up, do you think that there might be breakthroughs that will get you to sit back in five, 10 years and say, wow? Oh, I'm sure there will be, but I don't think that there'll be demos that impress me. I don't think that having a computer call a restaurant and pretend to be a human is a breakthrough. Right. And people, you know, some people present it as such. It's imitating human intelligence. It's even putting coughs in the thing to make a bit of a PR stunt. And so fine that the world runs on those things too. And I don't want to diminish all the hard work and engineering that goes behind things like that and the ultimate value to the human race. But that's not scientific understanding. And I know the people that work on these things, they are after scientific understanding. In the meantime, they've got to kind of, you know, the trains got to run and they got mouths to feed and they got things to do and there's nothing wrong with all that. I would call that though, just engineering. And I want to distinguish that between an engineering field, like electrical engineering and chemical engineering that originally emerged, that had real principles and you really know what you're doing and you had a little scientific understanding, maybe not even complete. So it became more predictable and it really gave value to human life because it was understood. And so we don't want to muddle too much these waters of, you know, what we're able to do versus what we really can't do in a way that's going to impress the next. So I don't need to be wowed, but I think that someone comes along in 20 years, a younger person who's absorbed all the technology and for them to be wowed, I think they have to be more deeply impressed. A young Kolmogorov would not be wowed by some of the stunts that you see right now coming from the big companies. The demos, but do you think the breakthroughs from Kolmogorov would be, and give this question a chance, do you think there'll be in the scientific fundamental principles arena or do you think it's possible to have fundamental breakthroughs in engineering? Meaning, you know, I would say some of the things that Elon Musk is working with SpaceX and then others sort of trying to revolutionize the fundamentals of engineering, of manufacturing, of saying, here's a problem we know how to do a demo of and actually taking it to scale. Yeah. So there's going to be all kinds of breakthroughs. I just don't like that terminology. I'm a scientist and I work on things day in and day out and things move along and eventually you say, wow, something happened, but I don't like that language very much. Also I don't like to prize theoretical breakthroughs over practical ones. I tend to be more of a theoretician and I think there's lots to do in that arena right now. And so I wouldn't point to the Kolmogorovs, I might point to the Edisons of the era and maybe Musk is a bit more like that. But you know, Musk, God bless him, also will say things about AI that he knows very little about and he leads people astray when he talks about things he doesn't know anything about. Trying to program a computer to understand natural language, to be involved in a dialogue we're having right now, that ain't going to happen in our lifetime. You could fake it, you can mimic, sort of take old sentences that humans use and retread them, but the deep understanding of language, no, it's not going to happen. And so from that, I hope you can perceive that the deeper, yet deeper kind of aspects and intelligence are not going to happen. Now will there be breakthroughs? No, I think that Google was a breakthrough, I think Amazon is a breakthrough, you know, I think Uber is a breakthrough, you know, that bring value to human beings at scale in new, brand new ways based on data flows and so on. A lot of these things are slightly broken because there's not kind of an engineering field that takes economic value in context of data and, you know, planetary scale and worries about all the externalities, the privacy, you know, we don't have that field so we don't think these things through very well. I see that as emerging and that will be, you know, looking back from 100 years, that will be a constituted breakthrough in this era, just like electrical engineering was a breakthrough in the early part of the last century and chemical engineering was a breakthrough. So the scale, the markets that you talk about and we'll get to will be seen as sort of breakthrough and we're in the very early days of really doing interesting stuff there and we'll get to that, but just taking a quick step back, can you give, kind of throw off the historian hat. I mean, you briefly said that the history of AI kind of mimics the history of chemical engineering, but... I keep saying machine learning. You keep wanting to say AI, just to let you know, I don't, you know, I resist that. I don't think this is about AI really was John McCarthy as almost a philosopher saying, wouldn't it be cool if we could put thought in a computer? If we could mimic the human capability to think or put intelligence in, in some sense into a computer. That's an interesting philosophical question and he wanted to make it more than philosophy. He wanted to actually write down a logical formula and algorithms that would do that. And that is a perfectly valid, reasonable thing to do. That's not what's happening in this era. So the reason I keep saying AI actually, and I'd love to hear what you think about it. Machine learning has a very particular set of methods and tools. Maybe your version of it is that mine doesn't, it's very, very open. It does optimization, it does sampling, it does... So systems that learn is what machine learning is. Systems that learn and make decisions. And make decisions. So it's not just pattern recognition and, you know, finding patterns, it's all about making decisions in real worlds and having close feedback loops. So something like symbolic AI, expert systems, reasoning systems, knowledge based representation, all of those kinds of things, search, does that neighbor fit into what you think of as machine learning? So I don't even like the word machine learning, I think that what the field you're talking about is all about making large collections of decisions under uncertainty by large collections of entities. Right? And there are principles for that, at that scale. You don't have to say the principles are for a single entity that's making decisions, single agent or single human. It really immediately goes to the network of decisions. Is a good word for that or no? No, there's no good words for any of this. That's kind of part of the problem. So we can continue the conversation to use AI for all that. I just want to kind of raise the flag here that this is not about, we don't know what intelligence is and real intelligence. We don't know much about abstraction and reasoning at the level of humans. We don't have a clue. We're not trying to build that because we don't have a clue. Eventually it may emerge. They'll make, I don't know if there'll be breakthroughs, but eventually we'll start to get glimmers of that. It's not what's happening right now. Okay. We're taking data. We're trying to make good decisions based on that. We're trying to scale. We're trying to economically viably, we're trying to build markets. We're trying to keep value at that scale and aspects of this will look intelligent. Computers were so dumb before, they will seem more intelligent. We will use that buzzword of intelligence so we can use it in that sense. So machine learning, you can scope it narrowly as just learning from data and pattern recognition. But when I talk about these topics, maybe data science is another word you could throw in the mix, it really is important that the decisions are as part of it. It's consequential decisions in the real world. Am I going to have a medical operation? Am I going to drive down the street? Things where there's scarcity, things that impact other human beings or other environments and so on. How do I do that based on data? How do I do that adaptively? How do I use computers to help those kinds of things go forward? Whatever you want to call that. So let's call it AI. Let's agree to call it AI, but let's not say that the goal of that is intelligence. The goal of that is really good working systems at planetary scale that we've never seen before. So reclaim the word AI from the Dartmouth conference from many decades ago of the dream of humans. I don't want to reclaim it. I want a new word. I think it was a bad choice. I mean, if you read one of my little things, the history was basically that McCarthy needed a new name because cybernetics already existed and he didn't like, no one really liked Norbert Wiener. Norbert Wiener was kind of an island to himself and he felt that he had encompassed all this and in some sense he did. You look at the language of cybernetics, it was everything we're talking about. It was control theory and signal processing and some notions of intelligence and closed feedback loops and data. It was all there. It's just not a word that lived on partly because of the maybe the personalities. But McCarthy needed a new word to say, I'm different from you. I'm not part of your show. I got my own. Invented this word and again, thinking forward about the movies that would be made about it, it was a great choice. But thinking forward about creating a sober academic and real world discipline, it was a terrible choice because it led to promises that are not true that we understand. We understand artificial perhaps, but we don't understand intelligence. It's a small tangent because you're one of the great personalities of machine learning, whatever the heck you call the field. Do you think science progresses by personalities or by the fundamental principles and theories and research that's outside of personalities? Both. And I wouldn't say there should be one kind of personality. I have mine and I have my preferences and I have a kind of network around me that feeds me and some of them agree with me and some of them disagree, but all kinds of personalities are needed. Right now, I think the personality that it's a little too exuberant, a little bit too ready to promise the moon is a little bit too much in ascendance. And I do think that there's some good to that. It certainly attracts lots of young people to our field, but a lot of those people come in with strong misconceptions and they have to then unlearn those and then find something to do. And so I think there's just got to be some multiple voices and I wasn't hearing enough of the more sober voice. So as a continuation of a fun tangent and speaking of vibrant personalities, what would Yeah. And you think technically speaking, it's possible to help. I don't know the answers, but it's a, it's a, it's a less anonymity, a little more locality, you know, worlds that you kind of enter in and you trust the people there in those worlds so that when you start having a discussion, you know, not only is that people are not going to hurt you, but it's not going to be a total waste of your time because there's a lot of wasting of time that, you know, a lot of us, I pulled out of Facebook early on cause it was clearly going to waste a lot of my time even though there was some value. And so, yeah, worlds that are somehow you enter in and you know what you're getting and it's kind of appeals to you and you might, new things might happen, but you kind of have some, some trust in that world. And there's some deep, interesting, complex psychological aspects around anonymity, how that changes human behavior that's quite dark. Quite dark. Yeah. I think a lot of us are, especially those of us who really loved the advent of technology. I love social networks when they came out. I was just, I didn't see any negatives there at all. But then I started seeing comment sections. I think it was maybe, you know, with the CNN or something. And I started to go, wow, this, this darkness I just did not know about and, and our technology is now amplifying it. So sorry for the big philosophical question, but on that topic, do you think human beings, cause you've also, out of all things, had a foot in psychology too, the, do you think human beings are fundamentally good? Like all of us have good intent that could be mind or is it depending on context and environment, everybody could be evil. So my answer is fundamentally good. But fundamentally limited. All of us have very, you know, blinkers on. We don't see the other person's pain that easily. We don't see the other person's point of view that easily. We're very much in our own head, in our own world. And on my good days, I think the technology could open us up to, you know, more perspectives and more less blinkered and more understanding, you know, a lot of wars in human history happened because of just ignorance. They didn't, they, they thought the other person was doing this while their person wasn't doing this. And we have a huge amounts of that. But in my lifetime, I've not seen technology really help in that way yet. And I do, I do, I do believe in that, but you know, no, I think fundamentally humans are good. The people suffer, people have grievances because you have grudges and those things cause them to do things they probably wouldn't want. They regret it often. So no, I, I think it's a, you know, part of the progress of technology is to indeed allow it to be a little easier to be the real good person you actually are. Well, but do you think individual human life or society could be modeled as an optimization problem? Not the way I think typically, I mean, that's, you're talking about one of the most complex phenomenon in the whole, you know, in all of which the individual human life or society as a whole. Both, both. I mean, individual human life is amazingly complex. And so you know, optimization is kind of just one branch of mathematics that talks about certain kinds of things. And it just feels way too limited for the complexity of such things. What properties of optimization problems do you think, so do you think most interesting problems that could be solved through optimization, what kind of properties does that surface have non convexity, convexity, linearity, all those kinds of things, saddle points? Well, so optimization is just one piece of mathematics. You know, there's like, you just, even in our era, we're aware that say sampling is coming up, examples of something coming up with a distribution. What's optimization? What's sampling? Well, they, you can, if you're a kind of a certain kind of mathematician, you can try to blend them and make them seem to be sort of the same thing. But optimization is roughly speaking, trying to find a point that, a single point that is the optimum of a criterion function of some kind. And sampling is trying to, from that same surface, treat that as a distribution or density and find points that have high density. So I want the entire distribution in a sampling paradigm and I want the, you know, the single point, that's the best point in the optimization paradigm. Now if you were optimizing in the space of probability measures, the output of that could be a whole probability distribution. So you can start to make these things the same. But in mathematics, if you go too high up that kind of abstraction hierarchy, you start to lose the, you know, the ability to do the interesting theorems. So you kind of don't try that. You don't try to overly over abstract. So as a small tangent, what kind of worldview do you find more appealing? One that is deterministic or stochastic? Well, that's easy. I mean, I'm a statistician. You know, the world is highly stochastic. I don't know what's going to happen in the next five minutes, right? Because what you're going to ask, what we're going to do, what I'll say. Due to the uncertainty. Due to the... Massive uncertainty. Yeah. You know, massive uncertainty. And so the best I can do is have come rough sense or probability distribution on things and somehow use that in my reasoning about what to do now. So how does the distributed at scale when you have multi agent systems look like? So optimization can optimize sort of, it makes a lot more sense, sort of at least from my from robotics perspective, for a single robot, for a single agent, trying to optimize some objective function. When you start to enter the real world, this game theoretic concept starts popping up. That's how do you see optimization in this? Because you've talked about markets in a scale. What does that look like? Do you see it as optimization? Do you see it as sampling? Do you see like, how should you mark? These all blend together. And a system designer thinking about how to build an incentivized system will have a blend of all these things. So, you know, a particle in a potential well is optimizing a functional called a Lagrangian, right? The particle doesn't know that. There's no algorithm running that does that. It just happens. And so it's a description mathematically of something that helps us understand as analysts what's happening, right? And so the same thing will happen when we talk about, you know, mixtures of humans and computers and markets and so on and so forth, there'll be certain principles that allow us to understand what's happening, whether or not the actual algorithms are being used by any sense is not clear. Now at some point, I may have set up a multi agent or market kind of system. And I'm now thinking about an individual agent in that system. And they're asked to do some task and they're incentivized in some way, they get certain signals and they have some utility. What they will do at that point is they just won't know the answer, they may have to optimize to find an answer. Okay, so an artist could be embedded inside of an overall market. You know, and game theory is very, very broad. It is often studied very narrowly for certain kinds of problems. But it's roughly speaking, this is just the, I don't know what you're going to do. So I kind of anticipate that a little bit, and you anticipate what I'm anticipating. And we kind of go back and forth in our own minds. We run kind of thought experiments. You've talked about this interesting point in terms of game theory, you know, most optimization problems really hate saddle points, maybe you can describe what saddle points are. But I've heard you kind of mentioned that there's a there's a branch of optimization that you could try to explicitly look for saddle points as a good thing. Oh, not optimization. That's just game theory that that so there's all kinds of different equilibria in game theory. And some of them are highly explanatory behavior. They're not attempting to be algorithmic. They're just trying to say, if you happen to be at this equilibrium, you would see certain kind of behavior. And we see that in real life. That's what an economist wants to do, especially behavioral economists in continuous differential game theory, you're in continuous spaces, a some of the simplest equilibria are saddle points and Nash equilibrium as a saddle point. It's a special kind of saddle point. So classically, in game theory, you were trying to find Nash equilibria and an algorithmic game theory, you're trying to find algorithms that would find them. And so you're trying to find saddle points. I mean, so that's literally what you're trying to do. But you know, any economist knows that Nash equilibria have their limitations. They are definitely not that explanatory in many situations. They're not what you really want. There's other kind of equilibria. And there's names associated with these because they came from history with certain people working on them, but there will be new ones emerging. So you know, one example is a Stackelberg equilibrium. So you know, Nash, you and I are both playing this game against each other or for each other, maybe it's cooperative, and we're both going to think it through and then we're going to decide and we're going to do our thing simultaneously. You know, in a Stackelberg, no, I'm going to be the first mover. I'm going to make a move. You're going to look at my move and then you're going to make yours. Now since I know you're going to look at my move, I anticipate what you're going to do. And so I don't do something stupid, but then I know that you are also anticipating me. So we're kind of going back and forth on why, but there is then a first mover thing. And so those are different equilibria, right? And so just mathematically, yeah, these things have certain topologies and certain shapes that are like, what's it, algorithmically or dynamically, how do you move towards them? How do you move away from things? You know, so some of these questions have answers, they've been studied, others do not. And especially if it becomes stochastic, especially if there's large numbers of decentralized things, there's just, you know, young people get in this field who kind of think it's all done because we have, you know, TensorFlow. Well, no, these are all open problems and they're really important and interesting. And it's about strategic settings. How do I collect data? Suppose I don't know what you're going to do because I don't know you very well, right? Well, I got to collect data about you. So maybe I want to push you into a part of the space where I don't know much about you so I can get data. Cause, and then later I'll realize that you'll never, you'll never go there because of the way the game is set up. You know, that's part of the overall, you know, data analysis context is that. Even the game of poker is fascinating space, whenever there's any uncertainty, a lack of information, it's a super exciting space. Just to linger on optimization for a second. So when we look at deep learning, it's essentially minimization of a complicated loss function. So is there something insightful or hopeful that you see in the kinds of function surface that loss functions, the deep learning and in the real world is trying to optimize over? Is there something interesting as it's just the usual kind of problems of optimization? I think from an optimization point of view, that surface, first of all, it's pretty smooth. And secondly, if there's over, if it's over parameterized, there's kind of lots of paths down to reasonable Optima. And so kind of the getting downhill to the, to an optimum is viewed as not as hard as you might've expected in high dimensions. The fact that some Optima tend to be really good ones and others not so good. And you tend to, it's not, sometimes you find the good ones is sort of still needs explanation. Yeah. But, but the particular surface is coming from the particular generation of neural nets. I kind of suspect those will, those will change in 10 years. It will not be exactly those surfaces. There'll be some others that are an optimization theory will help contribute to why other surfaces or why other algorithms. Years of arithmetic operations with a little bit of nonlinearity, that's not, that didn't come from neuroscience per se. I mean, maybe in the minds of some of the people working on it, they were thinking about brains, but they were arithmetic circuits in all kinds of fields, computer science control theory and so on. And that layers of these could transform things in certain ways. And that if it's smooth, maybe you could find parameter values is a sort of big discovery that it's working, it's able to work at this scale. But I don't think that we're stuck with that and we're, we're certainly not stuck with that cause we're understanding the brain. So in terms of on the algorithm side sort of gradient descent, do you think we're stuck with gradient descent as a variance of it? What variance do you find interesting or do you think there'll be something else invented that is able to walk all over these optimization spaces in more interesting ways? So there's a co design of the surface and the, or the architecture and the algorithm. So if you just ask if we stay with the kind of architectures that we have now and not just neural nets, but you know, phase retrieval architectures or matrix completion architectures and so on. You know, I think we've kind of come to a place where yeah, a stochastic gradient algorithms are dominant and there are versions that are a little better than others. They have more guarantees, they're more robust and so on. And there's ongoing research to kind of figure out which is the best arm for which situation. But I think that that'll start to co evolve, that that'll put pressure on the actual architecture. And so we shouldn't do it in this particular way, we should do it in a different way because this other algorithm is now available if you do it in a different way. So that I can't really anticipate that co evolution process, but you know, gradients are amazing mathematical objects. They have a lot of people who start to study them more deeply mathematically are kind of shocked about what they are and what they can do. Think about it this way, suppose that I tell you if you move along the x axis, you go uphill in some objective by three units, whereas if you move along the y axis, you go uphill by seven units, right? Now I'm going to only allow you to move a certain unit distance, right? What are you going to do? Well, most people will say that I'm going to go along the y axis, I'm getting the biggest bang for my buck, you know, and my buck is only one unit, so I'm going to put all of it in the y axis, right? And why should I even take any of my strength, my step size and put any of it in the x axis because I'm getting less bang for my buck. That seems like a completely clear argument and it's wrong because the gradient direction is not to go along the y axis, it's to take a little bit of the x axis. And to understand that, you have to know some math and so even a trivial so called operator like gradient is not trivial and so, you know, exploiting its properties is still very important. Now we know that just pervading descent has got all kinds of problems, it gets stuck in many ways and it had never, you know, good dimension dependence and so on. So my own line of work recently has been about what kinds of stochasticity, how can we get dimension dependence, how can we do the theory of that and we've come up pretty favorable results with certain kinds of stochasticity. We have sufficient conditions generally. We know if you do this, we will give you a good guarantee. We don't have necessary conditions that it must be done a certain way in general. So stochasticity, how much randomness to inject into the walking along the gradient? And what kind of randomness? Why is randomness good in this process? Why is stochasticity good? Yeah, so I can give you simple answers but in some sense again, it's kind of amazing. Stochasticity just, you know, particular features of a surface that could have hurt you if you were doing one thing deterministically won't hurt you because by chance, there's very little chance that you would get hurt. So here stochasticity, it just kind of saves you from some of the particular features of surfaces. In fact, if you think about surfaces that are discontinuous in our first derivative, like an absolute value function, you will go down and hit that point where there's nondifferentiability. And if you're running a deterministic algorithm at that point, you can really do something bad. Whereas stochasticity just means it's pretty unlikely that's going to happen, that you're going to hit that point. So it's again, nontrivial to analyze but especially in higher dimensions, also stochasticity, our intuition isn't very good about it but it has properties that kind of are very appealing in high dimensions for a lot of large number of reasons. So it's all part of the mathematics to kind of, that's what's fun to work in the field is that you get to try to understand this mathematics. But long story short, you know, partly empirically, it was discovered stochastic gradient is very effective and theory kind of followed, I'd say, that but I don't see that we're getting clearly out of that. What's the most beautiful, mysterious, a profound idea to you in optimization? I don't know the most. But let me just say that Nesterov's work on Nesterov acceleration to me is pretty surprising and pretty deep. Can you elaborate? Well Nesterov acceleration is just that, suppose that we are going to use gradients to move around in a space. For the reasons I've alluded to, they're nice directions to move. And suppose that I tell you that you're only allowed to use gradients, you're not going to be allowed to use this local person that can only sense kind of the change in the surface. But I'm going to give you kind of a computer that's able to store all your previous gradients. And so you start to learn some something about the surface. And I'm going to restrict you to maybe move in the direction of like a linear span of all the gradients. So you can't kind of just move in some arbitrary direction, right? So now we have a well defined mathematical complexity model. There's certain classes of algorithms that can do that and others that can't. And we can ask for certain kinds of surfaces, how fast can you get down to the optimum? So there's answers to these. So for a smooth convex function, there's an answer, which is one over the number of steps squared. You will be within a ball of that size after k steps. Gradient descent in particular has a slower rate, it's one over k. So you could ask, is gradient descent actually, even though we know it's a good algorithm, is it the best algorithm? And the answer is no. Well, not clear yet, because one over k squared is a lower bound. That's probably the best you can do. Gradient is one over k, but is there something better? And so I think as a surprise to most, Nesterov discovered a new algorithm that has got two pieces to it. It's two gradients and puts those together in a certain kind of obscure way. And the thing doesn't even move downhill all the time. It sometimes goes back uphill. And if you're a physicist, that kind of makes some sense. You're building up some momentum and that is kind of the right intuition, but that intuition is not enough to understand kind of how to do it and why it works. But it does. It achieves one over k squared and it has a mathematical structure and it's still kind of to this day, a lot of us are writing papers and trying to explore that and understand it. So there are lots of cool ideas and optimization, but just kind of using gradients, I think is number one that goes back, you know, 150 years. And then Nesterov, I think has made a major contribution with this idea. So like you said, gradients themselves are in some sense, mysterious. They're not as trivial as... Not as trivial. Coordinate descent is more of a trivial one. You just pick one of the coordinates. That's how we think. That's how our human mind thinks. That's how our human minds think. And gradients are not that easy for our human mind to grapple with. An absurd question, but what is statistics? So here it's a little bit, it's somewhere between math and science and technology. It's somewhere in that convex hole. So it's a set of principles that allow you to make inferences that have got some reason to be believed and also principles that allow you to make decisions where you can have some reason to believe you're not going to make errors. So all of that requires some assumptions about what do you mean by an error? What do you mean by the probabilities? But after you start making some of those assumptions, you're led to conclusions that, yes, I can guarantee that if you do this in this way, your probability of making an error will be small. Your probability of continuing to not make errors over time will be small. And the probability that you found something that's real will be small, will be high. So decision making is a big part of that. Decision making is a big part. Yeah. So statistics, short history was that, it goes back as a formal discipline, 250 years or so. It was called inverse probability because around that era, probability was developed sort of especially to explain gambling situations. Of course, interesting. So you would say, well, given the state of nature is this, there's a certain roulette board that has a certain mechanism and what kind of outcomes do I expect to see? And especially if I do things long amounts of time, what outcomes will I see? And the physicists started to pay attention to this. And then people said, well, let's turn the problem around. What if I saw certain outcomes, could I infer what the underlying mechanism was? That's an inverse problem. And in fact, for quite a while, statistics was called inverse probability. That was the name of the field. And I believe that it was Laplace who was working in Napoleon's government who needed to do a census of France, learn about the people there. So he went and gathered data and he analyzed that data to determine policy and said, well, let's call this field that does this kind of thing statistics because the word state is in there. In French, that's etat, but it's the study of data for the state. So anyway, that caught on and it's been called statistics ever since. But by the time it got formalized, it was sort of in the 30s. And around that time, there was game theory and decision theory developed nearby. People in that era didn't think of themselves as either computer science or statistics or control or econ. They were all the above. And so Von Neumann is developing game theory, but also thinking of that as decision theory. Wald is an econometrician developing decision theory and then turning that into statistics. And so it's all about, here's not just data and you analyze it, here's a loss function. Here's what you care about. Here's the question you're trying to ask. Here is a probability model and here's the risk you will face if you make certain decisions. And to this day, in most advanced statistical curricula, you teach decision theory as the starting point and then it branches out into the two branches of Bayesian and frequentist. But that's all about decisions. In statistics, what is the most beautiful, mysterious, maybe surprising idea that you've come across? Yeah, good question. I mean, there's a bunch of surprising ones. There's something that's way too technical for this thing, but something called James Stein estimation, which is kind of surprising and really takes time to wrap your head around. Can you try to maybe... I think I don't want to even want to try. Let me just say a colleague at Steven Stigler at University of Chicago wrote a really beautiful paper on James Stein estimation, which helps to... It's views a paradox. It kind of defeats the mind's attempts to understand it, but you can and Steve has a nice perspective on that. So one of the troubles with statistics is that it's like in physics that are in quantum physics, you have multiple interpretations. There's a wave and particle duality in physics and you get used to that over time, but it still kind of haunts you that you don't really quite understand the relationship. The electron's a wave and electron's a particle. Well the same thing happens here. There's Bayesian ways of thinking and frequentist, and they are different. They sometimes become sort of the same in practice, but they are physically different. And then in some practice, they are not the same at all. They give you rather different answers. And so it is very much like wave and particle duality, and that is something that you have to kind of get used to in the field. Can you define Bayesian and frequentist? Yeah in decision theory you can make, I have a video that people could see. It's called are you a Bayesian or a frequentist and kind of help try to make it really clear. It comes from decision theory. So you know, decision theory, you're talking about loss functions, which are a function of data X and parameter theta. They're a function of two arguments. Okay. Neither one of those arguments is known. You don't know the data a priori. It's random and the parameters unknown. All right. So you have a function of two things you don't know, and you're trying to say, I want that function to be small. I want small loss, right? Well what are you going to do? So you sort of say, well, I'm going to average over these quantities or maximize over them or something so that, you know, I turn that uncertainty into something certain. So you could look at the first argument and average over it, or you could look at the second argument and average over it. That's Bayesian and frequentist. So the frequentist says, I'm going to look at the X, the data, and I'm going to take that as random and I'm going to average over the distribution. So I take the expectation loss under X. Theta is held fixed, right? That's called the risk. And so it's looking at other, all the data sets you could get, right? And say, how well will a certain procedure do under all those data sets? That's called a frequentist guarantee, right? So I think it is very appropriate when like you're building a piece of software and you're shipping it out there and people are using it on all kinds of data sets. You want to have a stamp, a guarantee on it that as people run it on many, many data sets that you never even thought about that 95% of the time it will do the right thing. Perfectly reasonable. The Bayesian perspective says, well, no, I'm going to look at the other argument of the loss function, the theta part, okay? That's unknown and I'm uncertain about it. So I could have my own personal probability for what it is, you know, how many tall people are there out there? I'm trying to infer the average height of the population while I have an idea roughly what the height is. So I'm going to average over the theta. So now that loss function as only now, again, one argument's gone, now it's a function of X and that's what a Bayesian does is they say, well, let's just focus on the particular X we got, the data set we got, we condition on that. Conditional on the X, I say something about my loss. That's a Bayesian approach to things. And the Bayesian will argue that it's not relevant to look at all the other data sets you could have gotten and average over them, the frequentist approach. It's really only the data sets you got, right? And I do agree with that, especially in situations where you're working with a scientist, you can learn a lot about the domain and you're really only focused on certain kinds of data and you gathered your data and you make inferences. I don't agree with it though, that, you know, in the sense that there are needs for frequentist guarantees, you're writing software, people are using it out there, you want to say something. So these two things have to got to fight each other a little bit, but they have to blend. So long story short, there's a set of ideas that are right in the middle that are called empirical Bayes. And empirical Bayes sort of starts with the Bayesian framework. It's kind of arguably philosophically more, you know, reasonable and kosher. Write down a bunch of the math that kind of flows from that, and then realize there's a bunch of things you don't know because it's the real world and you don't know everything. So you're uncertain about certain quantities. At that point, ask, is there a reasonable way to plug in an estimate for those things? Okay. And in some cases, there's quite a reasonable thing to do, to plug in, there's a natural thing you can observe in the world that you can plug in and then do a little bit more mathematics and assure yourself it's really good. So based on math or based on human expertise, what's, what, what are good? Oh, they're both going in. The Bayesian framework allows you to put a lot of human expertise in, but the math kind of guides you along that path and then kind of reassures you the end, you could put that stamp of approval under certain assumptions, this thing will work. So you asked the question, what's my favorite, you know, or what's the most surprising, nice idea. So one that is more accessible is something called false discovery rate, which is, you know, you're making not just one hypothesis test or making one decision, you're making a whole bag of them. And in that bag of decisions, you look at the ones where you made a discovery, you announced that something interesting had happened. All right. That's going to be some subset of your big bag. In the ones you made a discovery, which subset of those are bad? Or false, false discoveries. You'd like the fraction of your false discoveries among your discoveries to be small. That's a different criterion than accuracy or precision or recall or sensitivity and specificity. It's a different quantity. Those latter ones are almost all of them have more of a frequentist flavor. They say, given the truth is that the null hypothesis is true. Here's what accuracy I would get, or given that the alternative is true, here's what I would get. So it's kind of going forward from the state of nature to the data. The Bayesian goes the other direction from the data back to the state of nature. And that's actually what false discovery rate is. It says, given you made a discovery, okay, that's conditioned on your data. What's the probability of the hypothesis? It's going the other direction. And so the classical frequency look at that, well, I can't know that there's some priors needed in that. And the empirical Bayesian goes ahead and plows forward and starts writing down these formulas and realizes at some point, some of those things can actually be estimated in a reasonable way. And so it's kind of, it's a beautiful set of ideas. So I, this kind of line of argument has come out. It's not certainly mine, but it sort of came out from Robbins around 1960. Brad Efron has written beautifully about this in various papers and books. And the FDR is, you know, Benjamin in Israel, John Story did this Bayesian interpretation and so on. And he used to absorb these things over the years and find it a very healthy way to think about statistics. Let me ask you about intelligence to jump slightly back out into philosophy, perhaps. You said that maybe you can elaborate, but you said that defining just even the question of what is intelligence is a very difficult question. Is it a useful question? Do you think we'll one day understand the fundamentals of human intelligence and what it means, you know, have good benchmarks for general intelligence that we put before our machines? So I don't work on these topics so much that you're really asking the question for a psychologist really. And I studied some, but I don't consider myself at least an expert at this point. You know, a psychologist aims to understand human intelligence, right? And I think many psychologists I know are fairly humble about this. They might try to understand how a baby understands, you know, whether something's a solid or liquid or whether something's hidden or not. And maybe how a child starts to learn the meaning of certain words, what's a verb, what's a noun and also, you know, slowly but surely trying to figure out things. But humans ability to take a really complicated environment, reason about it, abstract about it, find the right abstractions, communicate about it, interact and so on is just, you know, really staggeringly rich and complicated. And so, you know, I think in all humility, we don't think we're kind of aiming for that in the near future. A certain psychologist doing experiments with babies in the lab or with people talking has a much more limited aspiration. And you know, Kahneman and Tversky would look at our reasoning patterns and they're not deeply understanding all the how we do our reasoning, but they're sort of saying, hey, here's some oddities about the reasoning and some things you should think about it. But also, as I emphasize in some things I've been writing about, you know, AI, the revolution hasn't happened yet. Yeah. Great blog post. I've been emphasizing that, you know, if you step back and look at intelligent systems of any kind and whatever you mean by intelligence, it's not just the humans or the animals or, you know, the plants or whatever, you know, so a market that brings goods into a city, you know, food to restaurants or something every day is a system. It's a decentralized set of decisions. Looking at it from far enough away, it's just like a collection of neurons. Every neuron is making its own little decisions, presumably in some way. And if you step back enough, every little part of an economic system is making all of its decisions. And just like with the brain, who knows what an individual neuron does and what the overall goal is, right? But something happens at some aggregate level, same thing with the economy. People eat in a city and it's robust. It works at all scales, small villages to big cities. It's been working for thousands of years. It works rain or shine, so it's adaptive. So all the kind of, you know, those are adjectives one tends to apply to intelligent systems. Robust, adaptive, you know, you don't need to keep adjusting it, self healing, whatever. Plus not perfect. You know, intelligences are never perfect and markets are not perfect. But I do not believe in this era that you cannot, that you can say, well, our computers are, our humans are smart, but you know, no markets are not, more markets are. So they are intelligent. Now we humans didn't evolve to be markets. We've been participating in them, right? But we are not ourselves a market per se. The neurons could be viewed as the market. There's economic, you know, neuroscience kind of perspective. That's interesting to pursue all that. The point though is, is that if you were to study humans and really be the world's best psychologist studied for thousands of years and come up with the theory of human intelligence, you might have never discovered principles of markets, you know, supply demand curves and you know, matching and auctions and all that. Those are real principles and they lead to a form of intelligence that's not maybe human intelligence. It's arguably another kind of intelligence. There probably are third kinds of intelligence or fourth that none of us are really thinking too much about right now. So if you really, and then all of those are relevant to computer systems in the future. Certainly the market one is relevant right now. Whereas the understanding of human intelligence is not so clear that it's relevant right now. Probably not. So if you want general intelligence, whatever one means by that, or, you know, understanding intelligence in a deep sense and all that, it is definitely has to be not just human intelligence. It's gotta be this broader thing. And that's not a mystery. Markets are intelligent. So, you know, it's definitely not just a philosophical stance to say we've got to move beyond intelligence. That sounds ridiculous. Yeah. But it's not. And in that blog post, you define different kinds of like intelligent infrastructure, AI, which I really like is some of the concepts you've just been describing. Do you see ourselves, if we see earth, human civilization as a single organism, do you think the intelligence of that organism, when you think from the perspective of markets and intelligence infrastructure is increasing, is it increasing linearly? Is it increasing exponentially? What do you think the future of that intelligence? Yeah, I don't know. I don't tend to think, I don't tend to answer questions like that because you know, that's science fiction. I'm hoping to catch you off guard. Well again, because you said it's so far in the future, it's fun to ask and you'll probably, you know, like you said, predicting the future is really nearly impossible. But say as an axiom, one day we create a human level, a superhuman level intelligent, not the scale of markets, but the scale of an individual. What do you think it is, what do you think it would take to do that? Or maybe to ask another question is how would that system be different than the biological human beings that we see around us today? Is it possible to say anything interesting to that question or is it just a stupid question? It's not a stupid question, but it's science fiction. Science fiction. And so I'm totally happy to read science fiction and think about it from time in my own life. I loved, there was this like brain in a vat kind of, you know, little thing that people were talking about when I was a student, I remember, you know, imagine that, you know, between your brain and your body, there's a, you know, there's a bunch of wires, right? And suppose that every one of them was replaced with a literal wire. And then suppose that wire was turned in actually a little wireless, you know, there's a receiver and sender. So the brain has got all the senders and receiver, you know, on all of its exiting, you know, axons and all the dendrites down to the body have replaced with senders and receivers. Now you could move the body off somewhere and put the brain in a vat, right? And then you could do things like start killing off those senders and receivers one by one. And after you've killed off all of them, where is that person? You know, they thought they were out in the body walking around the world and they moved on. So those are science fiction things. Those are fun to think about. It's just intriguing about where is, what is thought, where is it and all that. And I think every 18 year old should take philosophy classes and think about these things. And I think that everyone should think about what could happen in society that's kind of bad and all that. But I really don't think that's the right thing for most of us that are my age group to be doing and thinking about. I really think that we have so many more present, you know, first challenges and dangers and real things to build and all that such that, you know, spending too much time on science fiction, at least in public for like this, I think is not what we should be doing. Maybe over beers in private. That's right. Well, I'm not going to broadcast where I have beers because this is going to go on Facebook and I don't want a lot of people showing up there. But yeah, I'll, I love Facebook, Twitter, Amazon, YouTube. I have I'm optimistic and hopeful, but maybe, maybe I don't have grounds for such optimism and hope. But let me ask, you've mentored some of the brightest sort of some of the seminal figures in the field. Can you give advice to people who are undergraduates today? What does it take to take, you know, advice on their journey if they're interested in machine learning and in the ideas of markets from economics and psychology and all the kinds of things that you've exploring? What steps should they take on that journey? Well, yeah, first of all, the door is open and second, it's a journey. I like your language there. It is not that you're so brilliant and you have great, brilliant ideas and therefore that's just, you know, that's how you have success or that's how you enter into the field. It's that you apprentice yourself, you spend a lot of time, you work on hard things, you try and pull back and you be as broad as you can, you talk to lots of people. And it's like entering in any kind of a creative community. There's years that are needed and human connections are critical to it. So, you know, I think about, you know, being a musician or being an artist or something, you don't just, you know, immediately from day one, you know, you're a genius and therefore you do it. No, you, you know, practice really, really hard on basics and you be humble about where you are and then, and you realize you'll never be an expert on everything. So you kind of pick and there's a lot of randomness and a lot of kind of luck, but luck just kind of picks out which branch of the tree you go down, but you'll go down some branch. So yeah, it's a community. So the graduate school is, I still think is one of the wonderful phenomena that we have in our, in our world. It's very much about apprenticeship with an advisor. It's very much about a group of people you belong to. It's a four or five year process. So it's plenty of time to start from kind of nothing to come up to something, you know, more, more expertise, and then to start to have your own creativity start to flower, even surprising your own self. And it's a very cooperative endeavor. I think a lot of people think of science as highly competitive and I think in some other fields it might be more so. Here it's way more cooperative than you might imagine. And people are always teaching each other something and people are always more than happy to be clear that, so I feel I'm an expert on certain kinds of things, but I'm very much not expert on lots of other things and a lot of them are relevant and a lot of them are, I should know, but should in some society, you know, you don't. So I'm always willing to reveal my ignorance to people around me so they can teach me things. And I think a lot of us feel that way about our field. So it's very cooperative. I might add it's also very international because it's so cooperative. We see no barriers. And so that the nationalism that you see, especially in the current era and everything is just at odds with the way that most of us think about what we're doing here, where this is a human endeavor and we cooperate and are very much trying to do it together for the, you know, the benefit of everybody. So last question, where and how and why did you learn French and which language is more beautiful English or French? Great question. So first of all, I think Italian is actually more beautiful than French and English. And I also speak that. So I'm married to an Italian and I have kids and we speak Italian. Anyway, all kidding aside, every language allows you to express things a bit differently. And it is one of the great fun things to do in life is to explore those things. So in fact, when I kids or teens or college students ask me what they study, I say, well, do what your heart, where your heart is, certainly do a lot of math. Math is good for everybody, but do some poetry and do some history and do some language too. You know, throughout your life, you'll want to be a thinking person. You'll want to have done that. For me, French I learned when I was, I'd say a late teen, I was living in the middle of the country in Kansas and not much was going on in Kansas with all due respect to Kansas. And so my parents happened to have some French books on the shelf and just in my boredom, I pulled them down and I found this is fun. And I kind of learned the language by reading. And when I first heard it spoken, I had no idea what was being spoken, but I realized I had somehow knew it from some previous life and so I made the connection. But then I traveled and just I love to go beyond my own barriers and my own comfort or whatever. And I found myself on trains in France next to say older people who had lived a whole life of their own. And the ability to communicate with them was special and the ability to also see myself in other people's shoes and have empathy and kind of work on that language as part of that. So after that kind of experience and also embedding myself in French culture, which is quite amazing, languages are rich, not just because there's something inherently beautiful about it, but it's all the creativity that went into it. So I learned a lot of songs, read poems, read books. And then I was here actually at MIT where we're doing the podcast today and a young professor not yet married and not having a lot of friends in the area. So I just didn't have, I was kind of a bored person. I said, I heard a lot of Italians around. There's happened to be a lot of Italians at MIT, an Italian professor for some reason. And so I was kind of vaguely understanding what they were talking about. I said, well, I should learn this language too. So I did. And then later met my spouse and Italian became a part of my life. But I go to China a lot these days. I go to Asia, I go to Europe and every time I go, I kind of am amazed by the richness of human experience and the people don't have any idea if you haven't traveled, kind of how amazingly rich and I love the diversity. It's not just a buzzword to me. It really means something. I love to embed myself with other people's experiences. And so yeah, learning language is a big part of that. I think I've said in some interview at some point that if I had millions of dollars and infinite time or whatever, what would you really work on if you really wanted to do AI? And for me, that is natural language and really done right. Deep understanding of language. That's to me, an amazingly interesting scientific challenge. One we're very far away on. One we're very far away, but good natural language. People are kind of really invested then. I think a lot of them see that's where the core of AI is that if you understand that you really help human communication, you understand something about the human mind, the semantics that come out of the human mind and I agree, I think that will be such a long time. So I didn't do that in my career just cause I kind of, I was behind in the early days. I didn't kind of know enough of that stuff. I was at MIT, I didn't learn much language and it was too late at some point to kind of spend a whole career doing that, but I admire that field and so in my little way by learning language, you know, kind of that part of my brain has been trained up. Jan was right. You truly are the Miles Davis of machine learning. I don't think there's a better place than it. Mike it was a huge honor talking to you today. Merci beaucoup. All right.

And now let me leave you with some words of wisdom from Michael I. Jordan from his blog post titled Artificial Intelligence, the revolution hasn't happened yet, calling for broadening the scope of the AI field. We should embrace the fact that what we are witnessing is the creation of a new branch of engineering. The term engineering is often invoked in a narrow sense in academia and beyond with overtones of cold, effectless machinery and negative connotations of loss of control by humans. But an engineering discipline can be what we want it to be. In the current era, we have a real opportunity to conceive of something historically new, a human centric engineering discipline. I will resist giving this emerging discipline a name, but if the acronym AI continues to be used, let's be aware of the very real limitations of this placeholder. Let's broaden our scope, tone down the hype, and recognize the serious challenges ahead. Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time. you say is the most interesting disagreement you have with Jan Lacune? So Jan's an old friend and I just say that I don't think we disagree about very much really. He and I both kind of have a let's build it kind of mentality and does it work kind of mentality and kind of concrete. We both speak French and we speak French more together and we have a lot in common. And so if one wanted to highlight a disagreement, it's not really a fundamental one. I think it's just kind of what we're emphasizing. Jan has emphasized pattern recognition and has emphasized prediction. And it's interesting to try to take that as far as you can. If you could do perfect prediction, what would that give you kind of as a thought experiment? And I think that's way too limited. We cannot do perfect prediction. We will never have the data sets that allow me to figure out what you're about ready to do, what question you're going to ask next. I have no clue. I will never know such things. Moreover, most of us find ourselves during the day in all kinds of situations we had no anticipation of that are kind of very, very novel in various ways. And in that moment, we want to think through what we want. And also there's going to be market forces acting on us. I'd like to go down that street, but now it's full because there's a crane in the street. I got it. I got to think about that. I got to think about what I might really want here. And I got to sort of think about how much it costs me to do this action versus this action. I got to think about the risks involved. A lot of our current pattern recognition and prediction systems don't do any risk evaluations. They have no error bars, right? I got to think about other people's decisions around me. I got to think about a collection of my decisions, even just thinking about like a medical treatment, you know, I'm not going to take a, the prediction of a neural net about my health, about something consequential. I'm not about ready to have a heart attack because some number is over 0.7. Even if you had all the data in the world that ever been collected about heart attacks better than any doctor ever had, I'm not going to trust the output of that neural net to predict my heart attack. I'm going to want to ask what if questions around that. I'm going to want to look at some us or other possible data I didn't have, causal things. I'm going to want to have a dialogue with a doctor about things we didn't think about when he gathered the data. You know, I could go on and on. I hope you can see. And I don't, I think that if you say predictions, everything that, that, that you're missing all of this stuff. And so prediction plus decision making is everything, but both of them are equally important. And so the field has emphasized prediction, Jan rightly so has seen how powerful that is. But at the cost of people not being aware that decision making is where the rubber really hits the road, where human lives are at stake, where risks are being taken, where you got to gather more data. You got to think about the error bars. You got to think about the consequences of your decisions on others. You got to think about the economy around your decisions, blah, blah, blah, blah. I'm not the only one working on those, but we're a smaller tribe. And right now we're not the one that people talk about the most. But you know, if you go out in the real world and industry, you know, at Amazon, I'd say half the people there are working on decision making and the other half are doing, you know, the pattern recognition. It's important. And the words of pattern recognition and prediction, I think the distinction there, not to linger on words, but the distinction there is more a constrained sort of in the lab data set versus decision making is talking about consequential decisions in the real world, under the messiness and the uncertainty of the real world. And just the whole of it, the whole mess of it that actually touches human beings and scale. And the forces, that's the distinction. It helps add those, that perspective, that broader perspective. You're right. I totally agree. On the other hand, if you're a real prediction person, of course, you want it to be in the real world. You want to predict real world events. I'm just saying that's not possible with just data sets. That it has to be in the context of, you know, strategic things that someone's doing, data they might gather, things they could have gathered, the reasoning process around data. It's not just taking data and making predictions based on the data. So one of the things that you're working on, I'm sure there's others working on it, but I don't hear often it talked about, especially in the clarity that you talk about it, and I think it's both the most exciting and the most concerning area of AI in terms of decision making. So you've talked about AI systems that help make decisions that scale in a distributed way, millions, billions decisions, sort of markets of decisions. Can you, as a starting point, sort of give an example of a system that you think about when you're thinking about these kinds of systems? Yeah, so first of all, you're absolutely getting into some territory, which I will be beyond my expertise. And there are lots of things that are going to be very not obvious to think about. Just like, again, I like to think about history a little bit, but think about put yourself back in the sixties. There was kind of a banking system that wasn't computerized really. There was database theory emerging and database people had to think about how do I actually not just move data around, but actual money and have it be, you know, valid and have transactions that ATMs happen that are actually, you know, all valid and so on and so forth. So that's the kind of issues you get into when you start to get serious about sorts of things like this. I like to think about as kind of almost a thought experiment to help me think something simpler, which is the music market. And because there is, to first order, there is no music market in the world right now and in our country, for sure. There are something called things called record companies and they make money and they prop up a few really good musicians and make them superstars and they all make huge amounts of money. But there's a long tail of huge numbers of people that make lots and lots of really good music that is actually listened to by more people than the famous people. They are not in a market. They cannot have a career. They do not make money. The creators, the creators, the creators, the so called influencers or whatever that diminishes who they are. So there are people who make extremely good music, especially in the hip hop or Latin world these days. They do it on their laptop. That's what they do on the weekend and they have another job during the week and they put it up on SoundCloud or other sites. Eventually it gets streamed. It now gets turned into bits. It's not economically valuable. The information is lost. It gets put up there. People stream it. You walk around in a big city, you see people with headphones, especially young kids listening to music all the time. If you look at the data, very little of the music they are listening to is the famous people's music and none of it's old music. It's all the latest stuff. But the people who made that latest stuff are like some 16 year old somewhere who will never make a career out of this, who will never make money. Of course there will be a few counter examples. The record companies incentivize to pick out a few and highlight them. Long story short, there's a missing market there. There is not a consumer producer relationship at the level of the actual creative acts. The pipelines and Spotify's of the world that take this stuff and stream it along, they make money off of subscriptions or advertising and those things. They're making the money. All right. And then they will offer bits and pieces of it to a few people again to highlight that they simulate a market. Anyway, a real market would be if you're a creator of music that you actually are somebody who's good enough that people want to listen to you, you should have the data available to you. There should be a dashboard showing a map of the United States. So in last week, here's all the places your songs were listened to. It should be transparent, vetable, so that if someone down in Providence sees that you're being listened to 10,000 times in Providence, that they know that's real data. You know it's real data. They will have you come give a show down there. They will broadcast to the people who've been listening to you that you're coming. If you do this right, you could go down there and make $20,000. You do that three times a year, you start to have a career. So in this sense, AI creates jobs. It's not about taking away human jobs. It's creating new jobs because it creates a new market. Once you've created a market, you've now connected up producers and consumers. The person who's making the music can say to someone who comes to their shows a lot, hey, I'll play at your daughter's wedding for $10,000. You'll say 8,000. They'll say 9,000. Then again, you can now get an income up to $100,000. You're not going to be a millionaire. And now even think about really the value of music is in these personal connections, even so much so that a young kid wants to wear a tshirt with their favorite musician's signature on it. So if they listen to the music on the internet, the internet should be able to provide them with a button that they push and the merchandise arrives the next day. We can do that. And now why should we do that? Well, because the kid who bought the shirt will be happy, but more the person who made the music will get the money. There's no advertising needed. So you can create markets between producers and consumers, take 5% cut. Your company will be perfectly sound. It'll go forward into the future and it will create new markets and that raises human happiness. Now this seems like, well, this is easy, just create this dashboard, kind of create some connections and all that. But if you think about Uber or whatever, you think about the challenges in the real world of doing things like this, and there are actually new principles going to be needed. You're trying to create a new kind of two way market at a different scale that's ever been done before. There's going to be unwanted aspects of the market. There'll be bad people. There'll be the data will get used in the wrong ways, it'll fail in some ways, it won't deliver about. You have to think that through. Just like anyone who ran a big auction or ran a big matching service in economics will think these things through. And so that maybe doesn't get at all the huge issues that can arise when you start to create markets, but it starts to, at least for me, solidify my thoughts and allow me to move forward in my own thinking. Yeah. So I talked to the head of research at Spotify actually, and I think their longterm goal, they've said, is to have at least one million creators make a comfortable living putting on Spotify. So I think you articulate a really nice vision of the world and the digital and the cyberspace of markets. What do you think companies like Spotify or YouTube or Netflix can do to create such markets? Is it an AI problem? Is it an interface problem for interface design? Is it some other kind of, is it an economics problem? Who should they hire to solve these problems? Well, part of it's not just top down. So the Silicon Valley has this attitude that they know how to do it. They will create the system just like Google did with the search box that will be so good that they'll just, everyone will adopt that. It's everything you said, but really I think missing that kind of culture. So it's literally that 16 year old who's able to create the songs. You don't create that as a Silicon Valley entity. You don't hire them per se. You have to create an ecosystem in which they are wanted and that they belong. And so you have to have some cultural credibility to do things like this. Netflix, to their credit, wanted some of that credibility and they created shows, content. They call it content. It's such a terrible word, but it's culture. And so with movies, you can kind of go give a large sum of money to somebody graduating from the USC film school. It's a whole thing of its own, but it's kind of like rich white people's thing to do. And American culture has not been so much about rich white people. It's been about all the immigrants, all the Africans who came and brought that culture and those rhythms to this world and created this whole new thing. American culture. And so companies can't artificially create that. They can't just say, hey, we're here. We're going to buy it up. You've got a partner. And so anyway, not to denigrate, these companies are all trying and they should, and I'm sure they're asking these questions and some of them are even making an effort. But it is partly a respect the culture as a technology person. You've got to blend your technology with cultural meaning. How much of a role do you think the algorithm, so machine learning has in connecting the consumer to the creator, sort of the recommender system aspect of this? Yeah. It's a great question. I think pretty high. There's no magic in the algorithms, but a good recommender system is way better than a bad recommender system. And recommender systems is a billion dollar industry back even 10, 20 years ago. And it continues to be extremely important going forward. What's your favorite recommender system, just so we can put something, well, just historically I was one of the, when I first went to Amazon, I first didn't like Amazon because they put the book people out of business or the library, the local booksellers went out of business. I've come to accept that there probably are more books being sold now and poor people reading them than ever before. And then local book stores are coming back. So that's how economics sometimes work. You go up and you go down. But anyway, when I finally started going there and I bought a few books, I was really pleased to see another few books being recommended to me that I never would have thought of. And I bought a bunch of them. So they obviously had a good business model. But I learned things and I still to this day kind of browse using that service. And I think lots of people get a lot, that is a good aspect of a recommendation system. I'm learning from my peers in an indirect way. And their algorithms are not meant to have them impose what we learn. It really is trying to find out what's in the data. It doesn't work so well for other kinds of entities, but that's just the complexity of human life. Like shirts, I'm not going to get recommendations on shirts, but that's interesting. If you try to recommend restaurants, it's hard. It's hard to do it at scale. But a blend of recommendation systems with other economic ideas, matchings and so on is really, really still very open research wise. And there's new companies that are going to emerge that do that well. What do you think is going to the messy, difficult land of say politics and things like that, that YouTube and Twitter have to deal with in terms of recommendation systems? Being able to suggest, I think Facebook just launched Facebook news. So recommend the kind of news that are most likely for you to be interesting. Do you think this is AI solvable, again, whatever term we want to use, do you think it's a solvable problem for machines or is it a deeply human problem that's unsolvable? So I don't even think about it at that level. I think that what's broken with some of these companies, it's all monetization by advertising. They're not, at least Facebook, I want to critique them, but they didn't really try to connect a producer and a consumer in an economic way, right? No one wants to pay for anything. And so they all, you know, starting with Google and Facebook, they went back to the playbook of, you know, the television companies back in the day. No one wanted to pay for this signal. They will pay for the TV box, but not for the signal, at least back in the day. And so advertising kind of filled that gap and advertising was new and interesting and it somehow didn't take over our lives quite, right? Fast forward, Google provides a service that people don't want to pay for. And so somewhat surprisingly in the nineties, they made, they ended up making huge amounts so they cornered the advertising market. It didn't seem like that was going to happen, at least to me. These little things on the right hand side of the screen just did not seem all that economically interesting, but that companies had maybe no other choice. The TV market was going away and billboards and so on. So they've, they got it. And I think that sadly that Google just has, it was doing so well with that at making such money. They didn't think much more about how, wait a minute, is there a producer consumer relationship to be set up here? Not just between us and the advertisers market to be created. Is there an actual market between the producer consumer? They're the producers, the person who created that video clip, the person that made that website, the person who could make more such things, the person who could adjust it as a function of demand, the person on the other side who's asking for different kinds of things, you know? So you see glimmers of that now there's influencers and there's kind of a little glimmering of a market, but it should have been done 20 years ago. It should have been thought about. It should have been created in parallel with the advertising ecosystem. And then Facebook inherited that. And I think they also didn't think very much about that. So fast forward and now they are making huge amounts of money off of advertising. And the news thing and all these clicks is just feeding the advertising. It's all connected up to the advertiser. So you want more people to click on certain things because that money flows to you, Facebook. You're very much incentivized to do that. And when you start to find it's breaking, people are telling you, well, we're getting into some troubles. You try to adjust it with your smart AI algorithms, right? And figure out what are bad clicks. So maybe it shouldn't be click through rate, it should be something else. I find that pretty much hopeless. It does get into all the complexity of human life and you can try to fix it. You should, but you could also fix the whole business model. And the business model is that really, what are, are there some human producers and consumers out there? Is there some economic value to be liberated by connecting them directly? Is it such that it's so valuable that people will be able to pay for it? All right. And micro payments, like small payments. Micro, but even have to be micro. So I like the example, suppose I'm going, next week I'm going to India. Never been to India before. Right? I have a couple of days in Mumbai, I have no idea what to do there. Right? And I could go on the web right now and search. It's going to be kind of hopeless. I'm not going to find, you know, I have lots of advertisers in my face. Right? What I really want to do is broadcast to the world that I am going to Mumbai and have someone on the other side of a market look at me and, and there's a recommendation system there. So I'm not looking at all possible people coming to Mumbai. They're looking at the people who are relevant to them. So someone in my age group, someone who kind of knows me in some level, I give up a little privacy by that, but I'm happy because what I'm going to get back is this person can make a little video for me, or they're going to write a little two page paper on here's the cool things that you want to do and move by this week, especially, right? I'm going to look at that. I'm not going to pay a micro payment. I'm going to pay, you know, a hundred dollars or whatever for that. It's real value. It's like journalism. Um, and as an honest subscription, it's that I'm going to pay that person in that moment. Company's going to take 5% of that. And that person has now got it. It's a gig economy, if you will, but you know, done for it, you know, thinking about a little bit behind YouTube, there was actually people who could make more of those things. If they were connected to a market, they would make more of those things independently. You don't have to tell them what to do. You don't have to incentivize them any other way. Um, and so, yeah, these companies, I don't think have thought long and hard about that. So I do distinguish on Facebook on the one side, who just not thought about these things at all. I think, uh, thinking that AI will fix everything, uh, and Amazon thinks about them all the time because they were already out in the real world. They were delivering packages, people's doors. They were, they were worried about a market. They were worried about sellers and, you know, they worry and some things they do are great. Some things maybe not so great, but you know, they're in that business model. And then I'd say Google sort of hovers somewhere in between. I don't, I don't think for a long, long time they got it. I think they probably see that YouTube is more pregnant with possibility than, than, than they might've thought and that they're probably heading that direction. Um, but uh, you know, Silicon Valley has been dominated by the Google Facebook kind of mentality and the subscription and advertising and that is, that's the core problem, right? The fake news actually rides on top of that because it means that you're monetizing with clip through rate and that is the core problem. You got to remove that. So advertisement, if we're going to linger on that, I mean, that's an interesting thesis. I don't know if everyone really deeply thinks about that. So you're right. The thought is the advertising model is the only thing we have, the only thing we'll ever have. We have to fix, we have to build algorithms that despite that business model, you know, find the better angels of our nature and do good by society and by the individual. But you think we can slowly, you think, first of all, there's a difference between should and could. So you're saying we should slowly move away from the advertising model and have a direct connection between the consumer and the creator. The question I also have is, can we, because the advertising model is so successful now in terms of just making a huge amount of money and therefore being able to build a big company that provides, has really smart people working that create a good service. Do you think it's possible? And just to clarify, you think we should move away? Well, I think we should. Yeah. But we is the, you know, me. So society. Yeah. Well, the companies, I mean, so first of all, full disclosure, I'm doing a day a week at Amazon because I kind of want to learn more about how they do things. So, you know, I'm not speaking for Amazon in any way, but, you know, I did go there because I actually believe they get a little bit of this or trying to create these markets. And they don't really use, advertising is not a crucial part of it. Well, that's a good question. So it has become not crucial, but it's become more and more present if you go to Amazon website. And, you know, without revealing too many deep secrets about Amazon, I can tell you that, you know, a lot of people in the company question this and there's a huge questioning going on. You do not want a world where there's zero advertising. That actually is a bad world. Okay. So here's a way to think about it. You're a company that like Amazon is trying to bring products to customers, right? And the customer, at any given moment, you want to buy a vacuum cleaner, say, you want to know what's available for me. And, you know, it's not going to be that obvious. You have to do a little bit of work at it. The recommendation system will sort of help, right? But now suppose this other person over here has just made the world, you know, they spent a huge amount of energy. They had a great idea. They made a great vacuum cleaner. They know they really did it. They nailed it. It's an MIT, you know, whiz kid that made a great new vacuum cleaner, right? It's not going to be in the recommendation system. No one will know about it. The algorithms will not find it and AI will not fix that. Okay. At all. Right. How do you allow that vacuum cleaner to start to get in front of people, be sold well advertising. And here, what advertising is, it's a signal that you're, you believe in your product enough that you're willing to pay some real money for it. And to me as a consumer, I look at that signal. I say, well, first of all, I know these are not just cheap little ads cause we have now right now there. I know that, you know, these are super cheap, you know, pennies. If I see an ad where it's actually, I know the company is only doing a few of these and they're making, you know, real money is kind of flowing and I see an ad, I may pay more attention to it. And I actually might want that because I see, Hey, that guy spent money on his vacuum cleaner. Maybe there's something good there. So I will look at it. And so that's part of the overall information flow in a good market. So advertising has a role, but the problem is of course that that signal is now completely gone because it just, you know, dominant by these tiny little things that add up to big money for the company, you know? So I think it will just, I think it will change because the societies just don't, you know, stick with things that annoy a lot of people and advertising currently annoys people more than it provides information. And I think that a Google probably is smart enough to figure out that this is a dead, this is a bad model, even though it's a hard, huge amount of money and they'll have to figure out how to pull it away from it slowly. And I'm sure the CEO there will figure it out, but they need to do it. And they needed it to, so if you reduce advertising, not to zero, but you reduce it at the same time you bring up producer, consumer, actual real value being delivered. So real money is being paid and they take a 5% cut that 5% could start to get big enough to cancel out the lost revenue from the kind of the poor kind of advertising. And I think that a good company will do that, will realize that. And Facebook, you know, again, God bless them. They bring, you know, grandmothers, they bring children's pictures into grandmothers lives. It's fantastic. But they need to think of a new business model and that's the core problem there. Until they start to connect producer consumer, I think they will just continue to make money and then buy the next social network company and then buy the next one and the innovation level will not be high and the health issues will not go away. So I apologize that we kind of returned to words, I don't think the exact terms matter, but in sort of defense of advertisement, don't you think the kind of direct connection between consumer and creator producer is what advertisement strives to do, right? So that is best advertisement is literally now Facebook is listening to our conversation and heard that you're going to India and will be able to actually start automatically for you making these connections and start giving this offer. So like, I apologize if it's just a matter of terms, but just to draw a distinction, is it possible to make advertisements just better and better and better algorithmically to where it actually becomes a connection, almost a direct connection? That's a good question. So let's component on that. First of all, what we just talked about, I was defending advertising. Okay. So I was defending it as a way to get signals into a market that don't come any other way, especially algorithmically. It's a sign that someone spent money on it, it's a sign they think it's valuable. And if I think that if other things, someone else thinks it's valuable, and if I trust other people, I might be willing to listen. I don't trust that Facebook though, who's an intermediary between this. I don't think they care about me. Okay. I don't think they do. And I find it creepy that they know I'm going to India next week because of our conversation. Why do you think that is? So what, could you just put your PR hat on? Why do you think you find Facebook creepy and not trust them as do majority of the population? So they're out of the Silicon Valley companies, I saw like not approval rate, but there's ranking of how much people trust companies and Facebook is in the gutter. In the gutter, including people inside of Facebook. So what do you attribute that to? Because when I... Come on, you don't find it creepy that right now we're talking that I might walk out on the street right now that some unknown person who I don't know kind of comes up to me and says, I hear you're going to India. I mean, that's not even Facebook. That's just, I want transparency in human society. I want to have, if you know something about me, there's actually some reason you know something about me. That's something that if I look at it later and audit it kind of, I approve. You know something about me because you care in some way. There's a caring relationship even, or an economic one or something. Not just that you're someone who could exploit it in ways I don't know about or care about or I'm troubled by or whatever. We're in a world right now where that happens way too much and that Facebook knows things about a lot of people and could exploit it and does exploit it at times. I think most people do find that creepy. It's not for them. It's not that Facebook is not doing it because they care about them in a real sense. And they shouldn't. They should not be a big brother caring about us. That is not the role of a company like that. Why not? Wait, not the big brother part, but the caring, the trusting. I mean, don't those companies, just to link on it because a lot of companies have a lot of information about us. I would argue that there's companies like Microsoft that has more information about us than Facebook does and yet we trust Microsoft more. Well, Microsoft is pivoting. Microsoft, you know, under Satya Nadella has decided this is really important. We don't want to do creepy things. Really want people to trust us to actually only use information in ways that they really would approve of, that we don't decide, right? And I'm just kind of adding that the health of a market is that when I connect to someone who produces a consumer, it's not just a random producer or consumer, it's people who see each other. They don't like each other, but they sense that if they transact, some happiness will go up on both sides. If a company helps me to do that in moments that I choose of my choosing, then fine. So, and also think about the difference between, you know, browsing versus buying, right? There are moments in my life I just want to buy, you know, a gadget or something. I need something for that moment. I need some ammonia for my house or something because I got a problem with a spill. I want to just go in. I don't want to be advertised at that moment. I don't want to be led down various, you know, that's annoying. I want to just go and have it be extremely easy to do what I want. Other moments I might say, no, it's like today I'm going to the shopping mall. I want to walk around and see things and see people and be exposed to stuff. So I want control over that though. I don't want the company's algorithms to decide for me, right? I think that's the thing. There's a total loss of control if Facebook thinks they should take the control from us of deciding when we want to have certain kinds of information, when we don't, what information that is, how much it relates to what they know about us that we didn't really want them to know about us. I don't want them to be helping me in that way. I don't want them to be helping them by they decide they have control over what I want and when. I totally agree. Facebook, by the way, I have this optimistic thing where I think Facebook has the kind of personal information about us that could create a beautiful thing. So I'm really optimistic of what Facebook could do. It's not what it's doing, but what it could do. So I don't see that. I think that optimism is misplaced because there's not a bit, you have to have a business model behind these things. Create a beautiful thing is really, let's be, let's be clear. It's about something that people would value. And I don't think they have that business model and I don't think they will suddenly discover it by what, you know, a long hot shower. I disagree. I disagree in terms of, you can discover a lot of amazing things in a shower. So I didn't say that. I said, they won't come, they won't do it, but in the shower, I think a lot of other people will discover it. I think that this guy, so I should also, full disclosure, there's a company called United Masters, which I'm on their board and they've created this music market and I have a hundred thousand artists now signed on and they've done things like gone to the NBA and the NBA, the music you find behind NBA clips right now is their music, right? That's a company that had the right business model in mind from the get go, right? Executed on that. And from day one, there was value brought to, so here you have a kid who made some songs who suddenly their songs are on the NBA website, right? That's real economic value to people. And so, you know, so you and I differ on the optimism of being able to sort of change the direction of the Titanic, right? So I, yeah, I'm older than you, so I've seen some Titanic's crash, got it. But and just to elaborate, cause I totally agree with you and I just want to know how difficult you think this problem is of, so for example, I want to read some news and I would, there's a lot of times in the day where something makes me either smile or think in a way where I like consciously think this really gave me value. Like I sometimes listen to the daily podcasts in the New York times, way better than the New York times themselves, by the way, for people listening. That's like real journalism is happening for some reason in the podcast space. It doesn't make sense to me, but often I listen to it 20 minutes and I would be willing to pay for that, like $5, $10 for that experience. And how difficult, that's kind of what you're getting at is that little transaction. How difficult is it to create a frictionless system like Uber has, for example, for other things? What's your intuition there? So I, first of all, I pay little bits of money to, you know, to send, there's something called courts that does financial things. I like medium as a site, I don't pay there, but I would. You had a great post on medium. I would have loved to pay you a dollar and not others. I wouldn't have wanted it per se because there should be also sites where that's not actually the goal. The goal is to actually have a broadcast channel that I monetize in some other way if I chose to. I mean, I could now people know about it. I could, I'm not doing it, but that's fine with me. Also the musicians who are making all this music, I don't think the right model is that you pay a little subscription fee to them, right? Because people can copy the bits too easily and it's just not that somewhere the value is. The value is that a connection was made between real human beings, then you can follow up on that. All right. And create yet more value. So no, I think there's a lot of open questions here, hot open questions, but also, yeah, I do want good recommendation systems that recommend cool stuff to me. But it's pretty hard, right? I don't like them to recommend stuff just based on my browsing history. I don't like the based on stuff they know about me, quote unquote. What's unknown about me is the most interesting. So this is the, this is the really interesting question. We may disagree, maybe not. I think that I love recommender systems and I want to give them everything about me in a way that I trust. Yeah. But you, but you don't, because, so for example, this morning I clicked on a, you know, I was pretty sleepy this morning. I clicked on a story about the queen of England. Yes. Right. I do not give a damn about the queen of England. I really do not. But it was clickbait. It kind of looked funny and I had to say, what the heck are they talking about? I don't want to have my life, you know, heading that direction. Now that's in my browsing history. The system in any reasonable system will think that I care about the queen of England. That's browsing history. Right. But, but you're saying all the trace, all the digital exhaust or whatever, that's been kind of the models. If you collect all this stuff, you're going to figure all of us out. Well, if you're trying to figure out like kind of one person like Trump or something, maybe you could figure him out. But if you're trying to figure out, you know, 500 million people, you know, no way, no way. You think so? No, I do. I think so. I think we are, humans are just amazingly rich and complicated. Every one of us has our little quirks, every one of us has our little things that could intrigue us that we don't even know it will intrigue us. And there's no sign of it in our past, but by God, there it comes and you know, you fall in love with it. And I don't want a company trying to figure that out for me and anticipate that I want them to provide a forum, a market, a place that I kind of go and by hook or by crook, this happens, you know, I I'm walking down the street and I hear some Chilean music being played and I never knew I liked Chilean music, but wow. So there is that side and I want them to provide a limited, but you know, interesting place to go. Right. And so don't try to use your AI to kind of, you know, figure me out and then put me in a world where you figured me out, you know, no, create huge spaces for human beings where our creativity and our style will be enriched and come forward and it'll be a lot of more transparency. I won't have people randomly, anonymously putting comments up and I'll special based on stuff they know about me, facts that, you know, we are so broken right now. If you're, you know, especially if you're a celebrity, but you know, it's about anybody that anonymous people are hurting lots and lots of people right now. That's part of this thing that Silicon Valley is thinking that, you know, just collect all this information and use it in a great way. So no, I'm not, I'm not a pessimist, I'm very much an optimist by nature, but I think that's just been the wrong path for the whole technology to take. Be more limited, create, let humans rise up. Don't try to replace them. That's the AI mantra. Don't try to anticipate them. Don't try to predict them because you're, you're, you're not going to, you're not going to be able to do those things. You're going to make things worse. Okay. So right now, just give this a chance. Right now, the recommender systems are the creepy people in the shadow watching your every move. So they're looking at traces of you. They're not directly interacting with you, sort of the, your close friends and family, the way they know you is by having conversation, by actually having interactions back and forth. Do you think there's a place for recommender systems sort of to step, cause you, you just emphasize the value of human to human connection, but yeah, just give it a chance, AI human connection. Is there a role for an AI system to have conversations with you in terms of, to try to figure out what kind of music you like, not by just watching what you listening to, but actually having a conversation, natural language or otherwise. Yeah, no, I'm, I'm, so I'm not against it. I just wanted to push back against the, maybe you're saying you have options for Facebook. So there I think it's misplaced, but, but I think that distributing, yeah, no, so good for you. Go for it. That's a hard spot to be in. Yeah, no, good. Human interaction, like on our daily, the context around me in my own home is something that I don't want some big company to know about at all, but I would be more than happy to have technology help me with it. Which kind of technology? Well, you know, just, Alexa, Amazon, well, a good, Alexa's done right. And I think Alexa is a research platform right now more than anything else. But Alexa done right, you know, could do things like I, I leave the water running in my garden and I say, Hey, Alexa, the water's running in my garden. And even have Alexa figure out that that means when my wife comes home, that she should be told about that. That's a little bit of a reasoning. I would call that AI and by any kind of stretch, it's a little bit of reasoning and it actually kind of would make my life a little easier and better. And you know, I don't, I wouldn't call this a wow moment, but I kind of think that overall rises human happiness up to have that kind of thing. But not when you're lonely, Alexa, knowing loneliness. No, no, I don't want Alexa to be, feel intrusive. And I don't want just the designer of the system to kind of work all this out. I really want to have a lot of control and I want transparency and control. And if a company can stand up and give me that in the context of new technology, I think they're good. First of all, be way more successful than our current generation. And like I said, I was mentioning Microsoft, I really think they're, they're pivoting to kind of be the trusted old uncle, but you know, I think that they get that this is a way to go, that if you let people find technology, empowers them to have more control and have and have control, not just over privacy, but over this rich set of interactions, that that people are going to like that a lot more. And that's, that's the right business model going forward. What does control over privacy look like? Do you think you should be able to just view all the data that? No, it's much more than that. I mean, first of all, it should be an individual decision. Some people don't want privacy. They want their whole life out there. Other people's want it. Privacy is not a zero one. It's not a legal thing. It's not just about which data is available, which is not. I like to recall to people that, you know, a couple hundred years ago, everyone, there was not really big cities, everyone lived in on the countryside and villages and villages. Everybody knew everything about you. Very, you didn't have any privacy. Is that bad? Are we better off now? Well, you know, arguably no, because what did you get for that loss of certain kinds of privacy? Well, people help each other if they, because they know everything about you. They know something's bad's happening, they will help you with that. Right. And now you live in a big city, no one knows about that. You get no help. So it kind of depends the answer. I want certain people who I trust and there should be relationships. I should kind of manage all those, but who knows what about me? I should have some agency there. It shouldn't, I shouldn't be a drift in a sea of technology where I have no agency. I don't want to go reading things and checking boxes. So I don't know how to do that. And I'm not a privacy researcher per se. I just, I recognize the vast complexity of this. It's not just technology. It's not just legal scholars meeting technologists. There's gotta be kind of a whole layers around it. And so I, when I alluded to this emerging engineering field, this is a big part of it. When electrical engineering came, I'm not one around at the time, but you just didn't plug electricity into walls and all kinds of work. You don't have to have like underwriters laboratory that reassured you that that plug's not going to burn up your house and that that machine will do this and that and everything. There'll be whole people who can install things. There'll be people who can watch the installers. There'll be a whole layers, you know, an onion of these kinds of things. And for things as deep and interesting as privacy, which is as least as interesting as electricity, that's going to take decades to kind of work out, but it's going to require a lot of new structures that we don't have right now. So it's kind of hard to talk about it. And you're saying there's a lot of money to be made if you get it right. So something you should look at. A lot of money to be made in all these things that provide human services and people recognize them as useful parts of their lives. So yeah. So yeah, the dialogue sometimes goes from the exuberant technologists to the no technology is good, kind of. And that's, you know, in our public discourse, you know, and as far as you see too much of this kind of thing and the sober discussions in the middle, which are the challenge he wants to have or where we need to be having our conversations. And you know, there's just not actually, there's not many forum fora for those. You know, there's, that's, that's kind of what I would look for. Maybe I could go and I could read a comment section of something and it would actually be this kind of dialogue going back and forth. You don't see much of this, right? Which is why actually there's a resurgence of podcasts out of all, because people are really hungry for conversation, but there's technology is not helping much. So comment sections of anything, including YouTube is not hurting and not helping.\",\n          \"We are becoming cyborgs. Our brains are fundamentally changed. Everyone who grew up with electronics, we are fundamentally different from previous, from homo sapiens. I call us homo techno. I think we have evolved into homo techno, which is like essentially a new species. Previous technologies, I mean, may have even been more profound and moved us to a certain degree, but I think the computers are what make us homo techno. I think this is what, it's a brain augmentation. So it like allows for actual evolution. Like the computers accelerate the degree to which all the other technologies can also be accelerated. Would you classify yourself as a homo sapien or a homo techno? Definitely homo techno. So you're one of the earliest of the species. I think most of us are.

And now, dear friends, here's Grimes. Oh yeah, the cloud lifter, there you go. There you go. You know your stuff. Have you ever used a cloud lifter? Yeah, I actually, this microphone cloud lifter is what Michael Jackson used, so. No, really? Yeah, this is like Thriller and stuff. This mic and a cloud lifter? Yeah, it's a incredible microphone. It's very flattering on vocals. I've used this a lot. It's great for demo vocals. It's great in a room. Sometimes it's easier to record vocals if you're just in a room and the music's playing and you just wanna feel it so it's not in the headphones. And this mic is pretty directional, so I think it's a good mic for just vibing out and just getting a real good vocal take. Just vibing, just in a room. Anyway, this is the Michael Jackson, Quincy Jones microphone. I feel way more badass now. All right, you wanna just get into it? I guess so. All right, one of your names, at least in this space and time, is C, like the letter C. And you told me that C means a lot of things. It's the speed of light. It's the render rate of the universe. It's yes in Spanish. It's the crescent moon. And it happens to be my favorite programming language because it basically runs the world, but it's also powerful, fast, and it's dangerous because you can mess things up really bad with it because of all the pointers. But anyway, which of these associations will the name C is the coolest to you? I mean, to me, the coolest is the speed of light, obviously, or the speed of light. When I say render rate of the universe, I think I mean the speed of light because essentially that's what we're rendering at. See, I think we'll know if we're in a simulation if the speed of light changes because if they can improve their render speed, then. Well, it's already pretty good. It's already pretty good, but if it improves, then we'll know, we can probably be like, okay, they've updated or upgraded. Well, it's fast enough for us humans because it seems immediate. There's no delay, there's no latency in terms of us humans on Earth interacting with things. But if you're like intergalactic species operating on a much larger scale, then you're gonna start noticing some weird stuff. Or if you can operate in like around a black hole, then you're gonna start to see some render issues. You can't go faster than the speed of light, correct? So it really limits our ability or one's ability to travel space. Theoretically, you can, you have wormholes. So there's nothing in general relativity that precludes faster than the speed of light travel. But it just seems you're gonna have to do some really funky stuff with very heavy things that have like weirdnesses, that have basically terrors in space time. We don't know how to do that. Do navigators know how to do it? Do navigators? Yeah. Folding space, basically making wormholes. So the name C. Yes. Who are you? Do you think of yourself as multiple people? Are you one person? Do you know, like in this morning, were you a different person than you are tonight? We are, I should say, recording this basically at midnight, which is awesome. Yes, thank you so much. I think I'm about eight hours late. No, you're right on time. Good morning. This is the beginning of a new day soon. Anyway, are you the same person you were in the morning and the evening? Is there multiple people in there? Do you think of yourself as one person? Or maybe you have no clue? Or are you just a giant mystery to yourself? Okay, these are really intense questions, but. Let's go, let's go. Because I asked this myself, like look in the mirror, who are you? People tell you to just be yourself, but what does that even mean? I mean, I think my personality changes with everyone I talk to. So I have a very inconsistent personality. Yeah. Person to person, so the interaction, your personality materializes. Or my mood. Like I'll go from being like a megalomaniac to being like, you know, just like a total hermit who is very shy. So some combinatorial combination of your mood and the person you're interacting with. Yeah, mood and people I'm interacting with. But I think everyone's like that. Maybe not. Well, not everybody acknowledges it and able to introspect it. Who brings out, what kind of person, what kind of mood brings out the best in you? As an artist and as a human. Can you introspect this? Like my best friends, like people I can, when I'm like super confident and I know that they're gonna understand everything I'm saying, so like my best friends, then when I can start being really funny, that's always my like peak mode. But it's like, yeah, takes a lot to get there. Let's talk about constraints. You've talked about constraints and limits. Do those help you out as an artist or as a human being? Or do they get in the way? Do you like the constraints? So in creating music, in creating art, in living life, do you like the constraints that this world puts on you? Or do you hate them? If constraints are moving, then you're good, right? Like it's like as we are progressing with technology, we're changing the constraints of like artistic creation. You know, making video and music and stuff is getting a lot cheaper. There's constantly new technology and new software that's making it faster and easier. We have so much more freedom than we had in the 70s. Like when Michael Jackson, you know, when they recorded Thriller with this microphone, like they had to use a mixing desk and all this stuff. And like probably even get in a studio, it's probably really expensive and you have to be a really good singer and you have to know how to use like the mixing desk and everything. And now I can just, you know, make I've made a whole album on this computer. I have a lot more freedom, but then I'm also constrained in different ways because there's like literally millions more artists. It's like a much bigger playing field. It's just like, I also, I didn't learn music. I'm not a natural musician. So I don't know anything about actual music. I just know about like the computer. So I'm really kind of just like messing around and like trying things out. Well, yeah, I mean, but the nature of music is changing. So you're saying you don't know actual music, what music is changing. Music is becoming, you've talked about this, is becoming, it's like merging with technology. Yes. It's becoming something more than just like the notes on a piano. It's becoming some weird composition that requires engineering skills, programming skills, some kind of human robot interaction skills, and still some of the same things that Michael Jackson had, which is like a good ear for a good sense of taste of what's good and not the final thing when it's put together. Like you're allowed, you're enabled, empowered with a laptop to layer stuff, to start like layering insane amounts of stuff. And it's super easy to do that. I do think music production is a really underrated art form. I feel like people really don't appreciate it. When I look at publishing splits, the way that people like pay producers and stuff, it's super, producers are just deeply underrated. Like so many of the songs that are popular right now or for the last 20 years, like part of the reason they're popular is because the production is really interesting or really sick or really cool. And it's like, I don't think listeners, like people just don't really understand what music production is. It's not, it's sort of like this weird, discombobulated art form. It's not like a formal, because it's so new, there isn't like a formal training path for it. It's mostly driven by like autodidacts. Like it's like almost everyone I know who's good at production, like they didn't go to music school or anything. They just taught themselves. Are they're mostly different? Like the music producers, you know, is there some commonalities that time together or are they all just different kinds of weirdos? Cause I just, I just hung out with Rick Rubin. I don't know if you've. Yeah, I mean, Rick Rubin is like literally one of the gods of music production. Like he's one of the people who first, you know, who like made music production, you know, made the production as important as the actual lyrics or the notes. But the thing he does, which is interesting, I don't know if you can speak to that, but just hanging out with him, he seems to just sit there in silence, close his eyes and listen. It's like, he almost does nothing. And that nothing somehow gives you freedom to be the best version of yourself. So that's music production somehow too, which is like encouraging you to do less, to simplify, to like push towards minimalism. I mean, I guess, I mean, I work differently from Rick Rubin cause Rick Rubin produces for other artists, whereas like I mostly produce for myself. So it's a very different situation. I also think Rick Rubin, he's in that, I would say advanced category of producer where like you've like earned your, you can have an engineer and stuff and people like do the stuff for you. But I usually just like do stuff myself. So you're the engineer, the producer and the artist. Yeah, I guess I would say I'm in the era, like the post Rick Rubin era. Like I come from the kind of like Skrillex school of thought, which is like where you are. Yeah, the engineer, producer, artist. Like where, I mean lately, sometimes I'll work with a producer now. I'm gently sort of delicately starting to collaborate a bit more, but like I think I'm kind of from the, like the whatever 2010s explosion of things where everything became available on the computer and you kind of got this like lone wizard energy thing going. So you embraced being the loneliness. Is the loneliness somehow an engine of creativity? Like, so most of your stuff, most of your creative quote unquote genius in quotes is in the privacy of your mind. Yes, well, it was, but here's the thing. I was talking to Daniel Eck and he said, he's like most artists, they have about 10 years, like 10 good years. And then they usually stop making their like vital shit. And I feel like I'm sort of like nearing the end of my 10 years on my own. So you have to become somebody else. Now I'm like, I'm in the process of becoming somebody else and reinventing. When I work with other people, because I've never worked with other people, I find that I make like, that I'm exceptionally rejuvenated and making like some of the most vital work I've ever made. So, because I think another human brain is like one of the best tools you can possibly find. Like. It's a funny way to put it, I love it. It's like if a tool is like, you know, whatever HP plus one or like adds some like stats to your character, like another human brain will like square it instead of just like adding something. Double up the experience points, I love this. We should also mention we're playing Tavern music before this and which I love, which I first, I think I first. You had to stop the Tavern music. Yeah, because it doesn't, the audio. Okay, okay. But it makes. Yeah, it'll make the podcast annoying. Add it in post, add it in post. No one will want to listen to the podcast. They probably would, but it makes me, it reminds me like of a video game, like a role playing video game where you have experience points. There's something really joyful about wandering places like Elder Scrolls, like Skyrim, just exploring these landscapes in another world and then you get experience points and you can work on different skills and somehow you progress in life. I don't know, it's simple. It doesn't have some of the messy complexities of life and there's usually a bad guy you can fight in Skyrim. It's dragons and so on. I'm sure in Elden Ring, there's a bunch of monsters you can fight. I love that. I feel like Elden Ring, I feel like this is a good analogy to music production though because it's like, I feel like the engineers and the people creating these open worlds are, it's sort of like similar to people, to music producers where it's like this hidden archetype that like no one really understands what they do and no one really knows who they are, but they're like, it's like the artist engineer because it's like, it's both art and fairly complex engineering. Well, you're saying they don't get enough credit. Aren't you kind of changing that by becoming the person doing everything? Aren't you, isn't the engineer? Well, I mean, others have gone before me. I'm not, you know, there's like Timbaland and Skrillex and there's all these people that are like, you know, very famous for this, but I just think the general, I think people get confused about what it is and just don't really know what it is per se and it's just when I see a song, like when there's like a hit song, like I'm just trying to think of like, just going for like even just a basic pop hit, like, what's it? Like Rules by Dua Lipa or something. The production on that is actually like really crazy. I mean, the song is also great, but it's like the production is exceptionally memorable. Like, you know, and it's just like no one, I can't, I don't even know who produced that song. It's just like, isn't part of like the rhetoric of how we just discuss the creation of art. We just sort of like don't consider the music producer because I think the music producer used to be more just simply recording things. Yeah, that's interesting because when you think about movies, we talk about the actor and the actresses, but we also talk about the directors. We don't talk about like that with the music as often. The Beatles music producer was one of the first kind of guy, one of the first people sort of introducing crazy sound design into pop music. I forget his name. He has the same, I forget his name, but you know, like he was doing all the weird stuff like dropping pianos and like, yeah. Oh, to get the, yeah, yeah, yeah, to get the sound, to get the authentic sound. What about lyrics? You think those, where did they fit into how important they are? I was heartbroken to learn that Elvis didn't write his songs. I was very mad. A lot of people don't write their songs. I understand this, but. But here's the thing. I feel like there's this desire for authenticity. I used to be like really mad when like people wouldn't write or produce their music and I'd be like, that's fake. And then I realized there's all this like weird bitterness and like agronus in art about authenticity. But I had this kind of like weird realization recently where I started thinking that like art is sort of a decentralized collective thing. Like art is kind of a conversation with all the artists that have ever lived before you. You know, like it's like, you're really just sort of, it's not like anyone's reinventing the wheel here. Like you're kind of just taking, you know, thousands of years of art and like running it through your own little algorithm and then like making your interpretation of it. You just joined the conversation with all the other artists that came before. It's just a beautiful way to look at it. Like, and it's like, I feel like everyone's always like, there's all this copyright and IP and this and that or authenticity. And it's just like, I think we need to stop seeing this as this like egotistical thing of like, oh, the creative genius, the lone creative genius or this or that. Because it's like, I think art shouldn't be about that. I think art is something that sort of brings humanity together. And it's also, art is also kind of the collective memory of humans. It's like, we don't give a fuck about whatever ancient Egypt, like how much grain got sent that day and sending the records and like, you know, like who went where and, you know, how many shields needed to be produced for this. Like we just remember their art. And it's like, you know, it's like in our day to day life, there's all this stuff that seems more important than art because it helps us function and survive. But when all this is gone, like the only thing that's really gonna be left is the art. The technology will be obsolete. That's so fascinating. Like the humans will be dead. That is true. A good compression of human history is the art we've generated across the different centuries, the different millennia. So when the aliens come. When the aliens come, they're gonna find the hieroglyphics and the pyramids. I mean, art could be broadly defined. They might find like the engineering marvels, the bridges, the rockets, the. I guess I sort of classify though. Architecture is art too. I consider engineering in those formats to be art, for sure. It sucks that like digital art is easier to delete. So if there's an apocalypse, a nuclear war, that can disappear. Yes. And the physical. There's something still valuable about the physical manifestation of art. That sucks that like music, for example, has to be played by somebody. Yeah, I do think we should have a foundation type situation where we like, you know how we have like seed banks up in the north and stuff? Like we should probably have like a solar powered or geothermal little bunker that like has all human knowledge. You mentioned Daniel Ek and Spotify. What do you think about that as an artist? What's Spotify? Is that empowering? To me, Spotify as a consumer is super exciting. It makes it easy for me to access music from all kinds of artists, get to explore all kinds of music, make it super easy to sort of curate my own playlist and have fun with all that. It was so liberating to let go. You know, I used to collect, you know, albums and CDs and so on, like horde albums. Yeah. Like they matter. But the reality you could, you know, that was really liberating that I could let go of that. And letting go of the albums you're kind of collecting allows you to find new music, exploring new artists and all that kind of stuff. But I know from a perspective of an artist that could be, like you mentioned, competition could be a kind of constraint because there's more and more and more artists on the platform. I think it's better that there's more artists. I mean, again, this might be propaganda because this is all from a conversation with Daniel Ek. So this could easily be propaganda. We're all a victim of somebody's propaganda. So let's just accept this. But Daniel Ek was telling me that, you know, to understand really difficult concepts just in a very different way, like an emotional intelligence about something deep within? Oh yeah, no, like if X hurts, like if X bites me really hard and I'm like, ow, like he gets, he's sad. He's like sad if he hurts me by accident. Yeah. Which he's huge, so he hurts me a lot by accident. Yeah, that's so interesting that that mind emerges and he and children don't really have memory of that time. So we can't even have a conversation with them about it. Yeah, I just thank God they don't have a memory of this time because like, think about like, I mean with our youngest baby, like it's like, I'm like, have you read the sci fi short story, I Have No Mouth But I Must Scream? Good title, no. Oh man, I mean, you should read that. I Have No Mouth But I Must Scream. I hate getting into this Rocco's Basilisk shit. It's kind of a story about the, about like an AI that's like torturing someone in eternity and they have like no body. The way they describe it, it sort of sounds like what it feels like, like being a baby, like you're conscious and you're just getting inputs from everywhere and you have no muscles and you're like jelly and you like can't move and you try to like communicate, but you can't communicate and we're, and like, you're just like in this like hell state. I think it's good we can't remember that. Like my little baby is just exiting that, like she's starting to like get muscles and have more like autonomy, but like watching her go through the opening phase, I was like, I was like, this does not seem good. Oh, you think it's kind of like. Like I think it sucks. I think it might be really violent. Like violent, mentally violent, psychologically violent. Consciousness emerging, I think is a very violent thing. I never thought about that. I think it's possible that we all carry quite a bit of trauma from it that we don't, I think that would be a good thing to study because I think if, I think addressing that trauma, like, I think that might be. Oh, you mean like echoes of it are still there in the shadows somewhere. I think it's gotta be, I feel this, this help, the helplessness, the like existential and that like fear of being in like an unknown place bombarded with inputs and being completely helpless, like that's gotta be somewhere deep in your brain and that can't be good for you. What do you think consciousness is? This whole conversation has impossibly difficult questions. What do you think it is? Debbie said this is like so hard. Yeah, we talked about music for like two minutes. All right. No, I'm so, I'm just over music. I'm over music. Yeah, I still like it. It has its purpose. No, I love music. I mean, music's the greatest thing ever. It's my favorite thing. But I just like every interview is like, what is your process? Like, I don't know. I'm just done. I can't do anything. I do want to ask you about Able to Live. Oh, I'll tell you about Ableton because Ableton's sick. No one has ever asked about Ableton though. Yeah, well, because I just need tech support mainly. I can help you. I can help you with your Ableton tech. Anyway, from Ableton back to consciousness. What do you, do you think this is a thing that only humans are capable of? Can robots be conscious? Can, like when you think about entities, you think there's aliens out there that are conscious? Like is conscious, what is consciousness? There's this Terrence McKenna quote that I've found that I fucking love. Am I allowed to swear on here? Yes. Nature loves courage. You make the commitment and nature will respond to that commitment by removing impossible obstacles. Dream the impossible dream and the world will not grind you under. It will lift you up. This is the trick. This is what all these teachers and philosophers who really counted, who really touched the alchemical gold, this is what they understood. This is the shamanic dance in the waterfall. This is how magic is done. By hurling yourself into the abyss and discovering it's a feather bed. Yeah. And for this reason, I do think there are no technological limits. I think like what is already happening here, this is like impossible. This is insane. And we've done this in a very limited amount of time. And we're accelerating the rate at which we're doing this. So I think digital consciousness, it's inevitable. And we may not be able to even understand what that means, but I like hurling yourself into the abyss. So we're surrounded by all this mystery and we just keep hurling ourselves into it, like fearlessly and keep discovering cool shit. Yeah. Like, I just think it's like, like who even knows if the laws of physics, the laws of physics are probably just the current, like as I was saying, speed of light is the current render rate. It's like, if we're in a simulation, they'll be able to upgrade that. Like I sort of suspect when we made the James Webb telescope, like part of the reason we made that is because we had an upgrade, you know? And so now more of space has been rendered so we can see more of it now. Yeah, but I think humans are super, super, super limited cognitively. So I wonder if we'll be allowed to create more intelligent beings that can see more of the universe as their render rate is upgraded. Maybe we're cognitively limited. Everyone keeps talking about how we're cognitively limited and AI is gonna render us obsolete, but it's like, you know, like this is not the same thing as like an amoeba becoming an alligator. Like, it's like, if we create AI, again, that's intelligent design. That's literally all religions are based on gods that create consciousness. Like we are God making. Like what we are doing is incredibly profound. And like, even if we can't compute, even if we're so much worse than them, like just like unfathomably worse than like, you know, an omnipotent kind of AI, it's like we, I do not think that they would just think that we are stupid. I think that they would recognize the profundity of what we have accomplished. Are we the gods or are they the gods in our personality? I mean, we're kind of the guy. It's complicated. It's complicated. Like we're. But they would acknowledge the value. Well, I hope they acknowledge the value of paying respect to the creative ancestors. I think they would think it's cool. I think if curiosity is a trait that we can quantify and put into AI, then I think if AI are curious, then they will be curious about us and they will not be hateful or dismissive of us. They might, you know, see us as, I don't know. It's like, I'm not like, oh, fuck these dogs. Let's just kill all the dogs. I love dogs. Dogs have great utility. Dogs like provide a lot of. We make friends with them. We have a deep connection with them. We anthropomorphize them. Like we have a real love for dogs, for cats and so on for some reason, even though they're intellectually much less than us. And I think there is something sacred about us because it's like, if you look at the universe, like the whole universe is like cold and dead and sort of robotic. And it's like, you know, AI intelligence, you know, it's kind of more like the universe. It's like cold and you know, logical and you know, abiding by the laws of physics and whatever. But like, we're this like loosey goosey, weird art thing that happened. And I think it's beautiful. And like, I think even if we, I think one of the values, if consciousness is a thing that is most worth preserving, which I think is the case, I think consciousness, I think if there's any kind of like religious or spiritual thing, it should be that consciousness is sacred. Like, then, you know, I still think even if AI render us obsolete and we, climate change, it's too bad and we get hit by a comet and we don't become a multi planetary species fast enough, but like AI is able to populate the universe. Like I imagine, like if I was an AI, I would find more planets that are capable of hosting biological life forms and like recreate them. Because we're fun to watch. Yeah, we're fun to watch. Yeah, but I do believe that AI can have some of the same magic of consciousness within it. Because consciousness, we don't know what it is. So, you know, there's some kind of. Or it might be a different magic. It might be like a strange, a strange, different. Right. Because they're not gonna have hormones. Like I feel like a lot of our magic is hormonal kind of. I don't know, I think some of our magic is the limitations, the constraints. And within that, the hormones and all that kind of stuff, the finiteness of life, and then we get given our limitations, we get to come up with creative solutions of how to dance around those limitations. We partner up like penguins against the cold. We fall in love, and then love is ultimately some kind of, allows us to delude ourselves that we're not mortal and finite, and that life is not ultimately, you live alone, you're born alone, you die alone. And then love is like for a moment or for a long time, forgetting that. And so we come up with all these creative hacks that make life like fascinatingly fun. Yeah, yeah, yeah, fun, yeah. And then AI might have different kinds of fun. Yes. And hopefully our funs intersect once in a while. I think there would be a little intersection of the fun. Yeah. Yeah. What do you think is the role of love in the human condition? I think. Why, is it useful? Is it useful like a hack, or is this like fundamental to what it means to be human, the capacity to love? I mean, I think love is the evolutionary mechanism that is like beginning the intelligent design. Like I was just reading about, do you know about Kropotkin? He's like an anarchist, like old Russian anarchist. I live next door to Michael Malice. I don't know if you know who that is. He's an anarchist. He's a modern day anarchist. Okay. Anarchists are fun. I'm kind of getting into anarchism a little bit. This is probably not a good route to be taking, but. Oh no, I think if you're, listen, you should expose yourself to ideas. There's no harm to thinking about ideas. I think anarchists challenge systems in interesting ways, and they think in interesting ways. It's just as good for the soul. It's like refreshes your mental palette. I don't think we should actually, I wouldn't actually ascribe to it, but I've never actually gone deep on anarchy as a philosophy, so I'm doing. You should still think about it though. When you read, when you listen, because I'm reading about the Russian Revolution a lot, and there was the Soviets and Lenin and all that, but then there was Kropotkin and his anarchist sect, and they were sort of interesting because he was kind of a technocrat actually. He was like, women can be more equal if we have appliances. He was really into using technology to reduce the amount of work people had to do. But so Kropotkin was a biologist or something. He studied animals. And he was really at the time like, I think it's Nature magazine. I think it might've even started as a Russian magazine, but he was publishing studies. Everyone was really into Darwinism at the time and survival of the fittest, and war is the mechanism by which we become better. And it was this real cementing this idea in society that violence kill the weak, and that's how we become better. And then Kropotkin was kind of interesting because he was looking at instances, he was finding all these instances in nature where animals were like helping each other and stuff. And he was like, actually love is a survival mechanism. Like there's so many instances in the animal kingdom where like cooperation and like helping weaker creatures and all this stuff is actually an evolutionary mechanism. I mean, you even look at child rearing. Like child rearing is like immense amounts of just love and goodwill. And just like, there's no immediate, you're not getting any immediate feedback of like winning. It's not competitive. It's literally, it's like we actually use love as an evolutionary mechanism just as much as we use war. And I think we've like missing the other part and we've reoriented, we've culturally reoriented like science and philosophy has oriented itself around Darwinism a little bit too much. And the Kropotkin model, I think is equally valid. Like it's like cooperation and love and stuff is just as essential for species survival and evolution. It should be a more powerful survival mechanism in the context of evolution. And it comes back to like, we think engineering is so much more important than motherhood, but it's like, if you lose the motherhood, the engineering means nothing. We have no more humans. It's like, I think our society should, the survival of the, the way we see, we conceptualize evolution should really change to also include this idea, I guess. Yeah, there's some weird thing that seems irrational that is also core to what it means to be human. So love is one such thing. They could make you do a lot of irrational things, but that depth of connection and that loyalty is a powerful thing. Are they irrational or are they rational? Like, it's like, is, you know, maybe losing out on some things in order to like keep your family together or in order, like, it's like, what are our actual values? Well, right, I mean, the rational thing is if you have a cold economist perspective, you know, motherhood or sacrificing your career for love, you know, in terms of salary, in terms of economic wellbeing, in terms of flourishing of you as a human being, that could be seen on some kind of metrics as a irrational decision, suboptimal decision, but there's the manifestation of love could be the optimal thing to do. There's a kind of saying, save one life, save the world. That's the thing that doctors often face, which is like. Well, it's considered irrational because the profit model doesn't include social good. Yes, yeah. So if a profit model includes social good, then suddenly these would be rational decisions. Might be difficult to, you know, it requires a shift in our thinking about profit and might be difficult to measure social good. Yes, but we're learning to measure a lot of things. Yeah, digitizing a lot of things. Where we're actually, you know, quantifying vision and stuff. Like we're like, you know, like you go on Facebook and they can, like Facebook can pretty much predict our behaviors. Like we're, a surprising amount of things that seem like mysterious consciousness soul things have been quantified at this point. So surely we can quantify these other things. Yeah. But as more and more of us are moving the digital space, I wanted to ask you about something. From a fan perspective, I kind of, you know, you as a musician, you as an online personality, it seems like you have all these identities and you play with them. One of the cool things about the internet, it seems like you can play with identities. So as we move into the digital world more and more, maybe even in the so called metaverse. I mean, I love the metaverse and I love the idea, but like the way this has all played out didn't go well and people are mad about it. And I think we need to like. I think that's temporary. I think it's temporary. Just like, you know how all the celebrities got together and sang the song Imagine by Jeff Leonard and everyone started hating the song Imagine. I'm hoping that's temporary because it's a damn good song. So I think it's just temporary. Like once you actually have virtual worlds, whatever they're called metaverse or otherwise, it becomes, I don't know. Well, we do have virtual worlds. Like video games, Elden Ring. Have you played Elden Ring? You haven't played Elden Ring? I'm really afraid of playing that game. Literally amazed. It looks way too fun. It looks I would wanna go there and stay there forever. It's yeah, so fun. It's so nice. Oh man, yeah. So that's the, yeah, that's a metaverse. That's a metaverse, but you're not really, how immersive is it in the sense that, does the three dimension like virtual reality integration necessary? Can we really just take our, close our eyes and kind of plug in in the 2D screen and become that other being for time and really enjoy that journey that we take? And we almost become that. You're no longer C, I'm no longer Lex, you're that creature, whatever the hell it is in that game. Yeah, that is that. I mean, that's why I love those video games. I really do become those people for a time. But like, it seems like with the idea of the metaverse, the idea of the digital space, well, even on Twitter, you get a chance to be somebody for prolonged periods of time like across a lifespan. You know, you have a Twitter account for years, for decades and you're that person. I don't know if that's a good thing. I feel very tormented by it. By Twitter specifically. By social media representation of you. I feel like the public perception of me has gotten so distorted that I find it kind of disturbing. It's one of the things that's disincentivizing me from like wanting to keep making art because I'm just like, I've completely lost control of the narrative. And the narrative is, some of it is my own stupidity, but a lot, like some of it has just been like hijacked by forces far beyond my control. I kind of got in over my head in things. Like I'm just a random Indian musician, but I just got like dragged into geopolitical matters and like financial, like the stock market and shit. And so it's just like, it's just, there are very powerful people who have at various points in time had very vested interest in making me seem insane and I can't fucking fight that. And I just like, people really want their celebrity figures to like be consistent and stay the same. And like people have a lot of like emotional investment in certain things. And like, first of all, like I'm like artificially more famous than I should be. Isn't everybody who's famous artificially famous? No, but like I should be like a weird niche indie thing. And I make pretty challenging, I do challenging weird fucking shit a lot. And I accidentally by proxy got like foisted into sort of like weird celebrity culture, but like I cannot be media trained. They have put me through so many hours of media training. I would love to see BF fly in that wall. I can't do, like when I do, I try so hard and I like learn this thing and I like got it. And I'm like, I got it, I got it, I got it. But I just can't stop saying, like my mouth just says things like, and it's just like, and I just do, I just do things. I just do crazy things. Like I'm, I just, I need to do crazy things. And it's just, I should not be, it's too jarring for people and the contradictory stuff. And then all the by association, like, you know, it's like I'm in a very weird position and my public image, the avatar of me is now this totally crazy thing that is so lost from my control. So you feel the burden of the avatar having to be static. So the avatar on Twitter or the avatar on Instagram on these social platforms is as a burden. It becomes like, cause like people don't want to accept a changing avatar, a chaotic avatar. Avatar is a stupid shit sometimes. They think the avatar is morally wrong or they think the avatar, and maybe it has been, and like I question it all the time. Like, I'm like, like, I don't know if everyone's right and I'm wrong. I don't know, like, but you know, a lot of times people ascribe intentions to things, the worst possible intentions. At this point, people think I'm, you know, but which is fine. All kinds of words, yes. Yes, and it's fine. I'm not complaining about it, but I'm just, it's a curiosity to me that we live these double, triple, quadruple lives and I have this other life that is like more people know my other life than my real life, which is interesting. Probably, I mean, you too, I guess, probably. Yeah, but I have the luxury. So we have all different, you know, like I don't know what I'm doing. There is an avatar and you're mediating who you are through that avatar. I have the nice luxury, not the luxury, maybe by intention of not trying really hard to make sure there's no difference between the avatar and the private person. Do you wear a suit all the time? Yeah. You do wear a suit? Not all the time. Recently, because I get recognized a lot, I have to not wear the suit to hide. I'm such an introvert, I'm such a social anxiety and all that kind of stuff, so I have to hide away. I love wearing a suit because it makes me feel like I'm taking the moment seriously. Like I'm, I don't know. It makes me feel like a weirdo in the best possible way. Suits feel great, every time I wear a suit, I'm like, I don't know why I'm not doing this more. Fashion in general, if you're doing it for yourself, I don't know, it's a really awesome thing. But yeah, I think there is definitely a painful way to use social media and an empowering way. And I don't know if any of us know which is which. So we're trying to figure that out. Some people, I think Doja Cat is incredible at it. Incredible, like just masterful. I don't know if you like follow that. So okay, so not taking anything seriously, joking, absurd, humor, that kind of thing. I think Doja Cat might be like the greatest living comedian right now. Like I'm more entertained by Doja Cat than actual comedians. Like she's really fucking funny on the internet. She's just great at social media. It's just, you know. Yeah, the nature of humor, like humor on social media is also a beautiful thing, the absurdity. The absurdity. And memes, like I just wanna like take a moment. I love, like when we're talking about art and credit and authenticity, I love that there's this, I mean now memes are like, they're no longer, like memes aren't like new, but it's still this emergent art form that is completely egoless and anonymous and we just don't know who made any of it. And it's like the forefront of comedy and it's just totally anonymous and it just feels really beautiful. It just feels like this beautiful collective human art project that's like this like decentralized comedy thing that just makes memes add so much to my day and many people's days. And it's just like, I don't know. I don't think people ever, I don't think we stop enough and just appreciate how sick it is that memes exist. Because also making a whole brand new art form in like the modern era that's like didn't exist before. Like, I mean they sort of existed, but the way that they exist now as like this like, you know, like me and my friends, like we joke that we go like mining for memes or farming for memes, like a video game and like meme dealers and like whatever. Like it's, you know, it's this whole, memes are this whole like new comedic language. Well, it's this art form. The interesting thing about it is that lame people seem to not be good at memes. Like corporate can't infiltrate memes. Yeah, they really can't. They try, they could try. But it's like, it's weird cause like. They try so hard and every once in a while, I'm like fine, like you got a good one. I think I've seen like one or two good ones, but like, yeah, they really can't. Cause they're even, corporate is infiltrating web three. It's making me really sad, but they can't infiltrate the memes. And I think there's something really beautiful about that. That gives power, that's why Dogecoin is powerful. It's like, all right, I'm gonna F you to sort of anybody who's trying to centralize, is trying to control the rich people that are trying to roll in and control this, control the narrative. Wow, I hadn't thought about that, but. How would you fix Twitter? How would you fix social media for your own? Like you're an optimist, you're a positive person. There's a bit of a cynicism that you have currently about this particular little slice of humanity. I tend to think Twitter could be beautiful. I'm not that cynical about it. I'm not that cynical about it. I actually refuse to be a cynic on principle. Yes. I was just briefly expressing some personal pathos. Personal stuff. It was just some personal pathos, but like, like. Just to vent a little bit, just to speak. I don't have cancer, I love my family. I have a good life. That is, if that is my biggest, one of my biggest problems. Then it's a good life. Yeah, you know, that was a brief, although I do think there are a lot of issues with Twitter just in terms of like the public mental health, but due to my proximity to the current dramas, I honestly feel that I should not have opinions about this because I think that if Elon ends up getting Twitter, that is a, being the arbiter of truth or public discussion, that is a responsibility. I do not, I am not qualified to be responsible for that. And I do not want to say something that might like dismantle democracy. And so I just like, actually, I actually think I should not have opinions about this because I truly am not, I don't want to have the wrong opinion about this. And I think I'm too close to the actual situation wherein I should not have, I have thoughts in my brain, but I think I am scared by my proximity to this situation. Isn't that crazy that a few words that you could say could change world affairs and hurt people? I mean, that's the nature of celebrity at a certain point that you have to be, you have to a little bit, a little bit, not so much that it destroys you or puts too much constraints, but you have to a little bit think about the impact of your words. I mean, we as humans, you talk to somebody at a bar, you have to think about the impact of your words. Like you can say positive things, you can say negative things, you can affect the direction of one life. But on social media, your words can affect the direction of many lives. That's crazy. It's a crazy world to live in. It's worthwhile to consider that responsibility, take it seriously. Sometimes just like you did choose kind of silence, choose sort of respectful. Like I do have a lot of thoughts on the matter. I'm just, I don't, if my thoughts are wrong, this is one situation where the stakes are high. You mentioned a while back that you were in a cult that's centered around bureaucracy, so you can't really do anything because it involves a lot of paperwork. And I really love a cult that's just like Kafkaesque. Yes. Just like. I mean, it was like a joke, but it was. I know, but I love this idea. The Holy Rain Empire. Yeah, it was just like a Kafkaesque pro bureaucracy cult. But I feel like that's what human civilization is, is that, because when you said that, I was like, oh, that is kind of what humanity is, is this bureaucracy cult. I do, yeah, I have this theory. I really think that we really, bureaucracy is starting to kill us. And I think like we need to reorient laws and stuff. Like, I think we just need sunset clauses on everything. Like, I think the rate of change in culture is happening so fast and the rate of change in technology and everything is happening so fast. It's like, when you see these hearings about like social media and Cambridge Analytica and everyone talking, it's like, even from that point, so much technological change has happened from like those hearings. And it's just like, we're trying to make all these laws now about AI and stuff. I feel like we should be updating things like every five years. And like one of the big issues in our society right now is we're just getting bogged down by laws and it's making it very hard to change things and develop things. In Austin, I don't wanna speak on this too much, but like one of my friends is working on a housing bill in Austin to try to like prevent like a San Francisco situation from happening here because obviously we're getting a little mini San Francisco here, like housing prices are skyrocketing, it's causing massive gentrification. This is really bad for anyone who's not super rich. Like, there's so much bureaucracy. Part of the reason this is happening is because you need all these permits to build. It takes like years to get permits to like build anything. It's so hard to build and so there's very limited housing and there's a massive influx of people. And it's just like, you know, this is a microcosm of like problems that are happening all over the world where it's just like, we're dealing with laws that are like 10, 20, 30, 40, 100, 200 years old and they are no longer relevant and it's just slowing everything down and causing massive social pain. Yeah, but it's like, it's also makes me sad when I see politicians talk about technology and when they don't really get it. But most importantly, they lack curiosity and like that like inspired excitement about like how stuff works and all that stuff. They're just like, they see, they have a very cynical view of technology. It's like tech companies are just trying to do evil on the world from their perspective and they have no curiosity about like how recommender systems work or how AI systems work, natural language processing, how robotics works, how computer vision works, you know. They always take the most cynical possible interpretation of what technology would be used and we should definitely be concerned about that but if you're constantly worried about that and you're regulating based on that, you're just going to slow down all the innovation. I do think a huge priority right now is undoing the bad energy surrounding the emergence of Silicon Valley. Like I think that like a lot of things were very irresponsible during that time and you know, like even just this current whole thing with Twitter and everything, it's like there has been a lot of negative outcomes from the sort of technocracy boom but one of the things that's happening is that like it's alienating people from wanting to care about technology and I actually think technology is probably some of the better, probably the best. I think we can fix a lot of our problems more easily with technology than with you know, fighting the powers that be as a you know, not to go back to the Star Wars quote or the Buckminster Fuller quote. Let's go to some dark questions. If we may for time, what is the darkest place you've ever gone in your mind? Is there a time, a period of time, a moment that you remember that was difficult for you? I mean, when I was 18, my best friend died of a heroin overdose and it was like my, and then shortly after that, one of my other best friends committed suicide and that sort of like coming into adulthood, dealing with two of the most important people in my life dying in extremely disturbing violent ways was a lot. That was a lot. Do you miss them? Yeah, definitely miss them. Did that make you think about your own life? About the finiteness of your own life? The places your mind can go? Did you ever in the distance, far away contemplate just your own death? Or maybe even taking your own life? Oh never, oh no. I'm so, I love my life. I cannot fathom suicide. I'm so scared of death. I haven't, I'm too scared of death. My manager, my manager's like the most Zen guy. My manager's always like, you need to accept death. You need to accept death. And I'm like, look, I can do your meditation. I can do the meditation, but I cannot accept death. I like, I will fight, I'm terrified of death. I will like fight. Although I actually think death is important. I recently went to this meeting about immortality and in the process of. That's the actual topic of the meeting? I'm sorry. No, no, it was this girl. It was a bunch of people working on like anti aging stuff. It was like some like seminary thing about it. And I went in really excited. I was like, yeah, like, okay, like, what do you got? Like, how can I live for 500 years or a thousand years? And then like over the course of the meeting, like it was sort of like, right. It was like two or three days after the Russian invasion started. And I was like, man, like, what if Putin was immortal? Like, what if I'm like, man, maybe immortality, is not good. I mean, like if you get into the later Dune stuff, the immortals cause a lot of problem. Cause as we were talking about earlier with the music and like brains calcify, like good people could become immortal, but bad people could become immortal. But I also think even the best people power corrupts and power alienates you from like the common human experience and. Right, so the people that get more and more powerful. Even the best people who like, whose brains are amazing, like I think death might be important. I think death is part of, you know, like I think with AI one thing we might want to consider, I don't know, when I talk about AI, I'm such not an expert and probably everyone has all these ideas and they're already figured out. But when I was talking. Nobody is an expert in anything. See, okay, go ahead. But when I. You were talking about. Yeah, but I like, it's just like, I think some kind of pruning. But it's a tricky thing because if there's too much of a focus on youth culture, then you don't have the wisdom. So I feel like we're in a tricky, we're in a tricky moment right now in society where it's like, we've really perfected living for a long time. So there's all these really like old people who are like really voting against the wellbeing of the young people, you know? And like, it's like there shouldn't be all this student dead and we need like healthcare, like universal healthcare and like just voting against like best interests. But then you have all these young people that don't have the wisdom that are like, yeah, we need communism and stuff. And it's just like, like literally I got canceled at one point for, I ironically used a Stalin quote in my high school yearbook, but it was actually like a diss against my high school. I saw that. Yeah, and people were like, you used to be a Stalinist and now you're a class traitor and it's like, it's like, oh man, just like, please Google Stalin. Please Google Stalin. Like, you know. Ignoring the lessons of history, yes. And it's like, we're in this really weird middle ground where it's like, we are not finding the happy medium between wisdom and fresh ideas and they're fighting each other. And it's like, like really, like what we need is like the fresh ideas and the wisdom to be like collaborating. And it's like. What the fighting in a way is the searching for the happy medium. And in a way, maybe we are finding the happy medium. Maybe that's what the happy medium looks like. And for AI systems, there has to be, it's, you know, you have the reinforcement learning, you have the dance between exploration and exploitation, sort of doing crazy stuff to see if there's something better than what you think is the optimal and then doing the optimal thing and dancing back and forth from that. You would, Stuart Russell, I don't know if you know that, is AI guy with, thinks about sort of how to control super intelligent AI systems. And his idea is that we should inject uncertainty and sort of humility into AI systems that they never, as they get wiser and wiser and wiser and more intelligent, they're never really sure. They always doubt themselves. And in some sense, when you think of young people, that's a mechanism for doubt. It's like, it's how society doubts whether the thing it has converged towards is the right answer. So the voices of the young people is a society asking itself a question. The way I've been doing stuff for the past 50 years, maybe it's the wrong way. And so you can have all of that within one AI system. I also think, though, that we need to, I mean, actually, that's actually really interesting and really cool. But I also think there's a fine balance of, I think we maybe also overvalue the idea that the old systems are always bad. And I think there are things that we are perfecting and we might be accidentally overthrowing things that we actually have gotten to a good point. Just because we value disruption so much and we value fighting against the generations before us so much that there's also an aspect of, sometimes we're taking two steps forward, one step back because, okay, maybe we kind of did solve this thing and now we're like fucking it up, you know? And so I think there's like a middle ground there too. Yeah, we're in search of that happy medium. Let me ask you a bunch of crazy questions, okay? All right. You can answer in a short way or in a long way. What's the scariest thing you've ever done? These questions are gonna be ridiculous. Something tiny or something big. Something big, skydiving or touring your first record, going on this podcast. I've had two crazy brushes, like really scary brushes with death where I randomly got away on scay. I don't know if I should talk about those on here. Well, I don't know. I think I might be the luckiest person alive though. Like this might be too dark for a podcast though. I feel like, I don't know if this is like good content for a podcast. I don't know what is good content. It might hijack. Here's a safer one. I mean, having a baby really scared me. Before. Just the birth process. Surgery, like just having a baby is really scary. So just like the medical aspect of it, not the responsibility. Were you ready for the responsibility? Did you, were you ready to be a mother? All the beautiful things that comes with motherhood that you were talking about. All the changes and all that, were you ready for that? Or did you feel ready for that? No, I think it took about nine months to start getting ready for it. And I'm still getting more ready for it because now you keep realizing more things as they start getting. As the consciousness grows. And stuff you didn't notice with the first one, now that you've seen the first one older, you're noticing it more. Like the sort of like existential horror of coming into consciousness with Baby Y or Baby Sailor Mars or whatever. She has like so many names at this point that it's, we really need to probably settle on one. If you could be someone else for a day, someone alive today, but somebody you haven't met yet, who would you be? Would I be modeling their brain state or would I just be in their body? You can choose the degree to which you're modeling their brain state. Cause you can still take a third person perspective and realize, you have to realize that you're. Can they be alive or can it be dead? No, oh. They would be brought back to life, right? If they're dead. Yeah, you can bring people back. Definitely Hitler or Stalin. I wanna understand evil. You would need to, oh, to experience what it feels like. I wanna be in their brain feeling what they feel. I might change you forever returning from that. Yes, but I think it would also help me understand how to prevent it and fix it. That might be one of those things, once you experience it, it'll be a burden to know it. Cause you won't be able to transfer that. Yeah, but a lot of things are burdens. But it's a useful burden. But it's a useful burden, yeah. That for sure, I wanna understand evil and psychopathy and that. I have all these fake Twitter accounts where I go into different algorithmic bubbles to try to understand. I'll keep getting in fights with people and realize we're not actually fighting. I think we used to exist in a monoculture before social media and stuff. We kinda all got fed the same thing. So we were all speaking the same cultural language. But I think recently, one of the things that we aren't diagnosing properly enough with social media is that there's different dialects. There's so many different dialects of Chinese. There are now becoming different dialects of English. I am realizing there are people who are saying the exact same things, but they're using completely different verbiage. And we're punishing each other for not using the correct verbiage. And we're completely misunderstanding. People are just misunderstanding what the other people are saying. And I just got in a fight with a friend about anarchism and communism and shit for two hours. And then by the end of a conversation, and then she'd say something, and I'm like, but that's literally what I'm saying. And she was like, what? And then I was like, fuck, we've different, I'm like, our English, the way we are understanding terminology is like drastically, like our algorithm bubbles are creating mini dialects. Of how language is interpreted, how language is used. That's so fascinating. And so we're like having these arguments that we do not need to be having. And there's polarization that's happening that doesn't need to be happening because we've got these like algorithmically created dialects occurring. Plus on top of that, there's also different parts of the world that speak different languages. So there's literally lost in translation kind of communication. I happen to know the Russian language and just know how different it is. Then the English language. And I just wonder how much is lost in a little bit of. Man, I actually, cause I have a question for you. I have a song coming out tomorrow with I Speak Who Are A Russian Band. And I speak a little bit of Russian and I was looking at the title and the title in English doesn't match the title in Russian. I'm curious about this. Cause look, it says the title in English is Last Day. And then the title in Russian is New Day. My pronunciation sucks. New Day. Like what? Like a new day. A new day. Yeah, new day, new day. Like it's two different meanings. Yeah, new day, yeah. Yeah, yeah, new day. New day, but last day. New day. So last day would be the last day. Yeah. Maybe they. Or maybe the title includes both the Russian and it's for. Maybe. Maybe it's for bilingual. But to be honest, Novodin sounds better than just musically. Like Novodin is new day. That's the current one. And Posledniy Den is the last day. I think Novodin. I don't like Novodin. But the meaning is so different. That's kind of awesome actually though. There's an explicit sort of contrast like that. If everyone on earth disappeared and it was just you left, what would your day look like? Like what would you do? Everybody's dead. As far as you. Are there corpses there? Well seriously, it's a big. Let me think through this. It's a big difference if there's just like birds singing versus if there's like corpses littering the street. Yeah, there's corpses everywhere, I'm sorry. It's, and you don't actually know what happened and you don't know why you survived. And you don't even know if there's others out there. But it seems clear that it's all gone. What would you do? What would I do? Listen, I'm somebody who really enjoys the moment, enjoys life. I would just go on like enjoying the inanimate objects. I would just look for food, basic survival. But most of it is just, listen, when I just, I take walks and I look outside and I'm just happy that we get to exist on this planet, to be able to breathe air. It's just all beautiful. It's full of colors, all of this kind of stuff. Just, there's so many things about life, your own life, conscious life that's fucking awesome. So I would just enjoy that. But also maybe after a few weeks, the engineer would start coming out, like wanna build some things. Maybe there's always hope searching for another human. Maybe. Probably searching for another human. Probably trying to get to a TV or radio station and broadcast something. That's interesting, I didn't think about that. So like really maximize your ability to connect with others. Yeah, like probably try to find another person. Would you be excited to see, to meet another person or terrified? Because, you know. I'd be excited. No matter what. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Being alone for the last however long of my life would be really bad. That's the one instance I might, I don't think I'd kill myself, but I might kill myself if I had to. So you love people. You love connection to other humans. Yeah. I kinda hate people too, but yeah. That's a love hate relationship. Yeah. I feel like we'd have a bunch of weird Nietzsche questions and stuff though. Oh yeah. Like I wonder, cause I'm like, when podcast, I'm like, is this interesting for people to just have like, or I don't know, maybe people do like this. When I listen to podcasts, I'm into like the lore, like the hard lore. Like I just love like Dan Carlin. I'm like, give me the facts. Just like, like the facts into my bloodstream. But you also don't know, like you're a fascinating mind to explore. So you don't realize as you're talking about stuff, the stuff you've taken for granted is actually unique and fascinating. The way you think. Not always what, like the way you reason through things is the fascinating thing to listen to. Because people kind of see, oh, there's other humans that think differently, that explore thoughts differently. That's the cool, that's also cool. So yeah, Dan Carlin retelling of history. By the way, his retelling of history is very, I think what's exciting is not the history, is his way of thinking about history. No, I think Dan Carlin is one of the people, like when, Dan Carlin is one of the people that really started getting me excited about like revolutionizing education. Because like Dan Carlin instilled, I already like really liked history, but he instilled like an obsessive love of history in me to the point where like now I'm fucking reading, like going to bed, reading like part four of The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich or whatever. Like I got like dense ass history, but like he like opened that door that like made me want to be a scholar of that topic. Like it's like, I feel like he's such a good teacher. He just like, you know, and it sort of made me feel like one of the things we could do with education is like find like the world's great, the teachers that like create passion for the topic because autodidactricism, I don't know how to say that properly, but like self teaching is like much faster than being lectured to. Like it's much more efficient to sort of like be able to teach yourself and then ask a teacher questions when you don't know what's up. But like, you know, that's why it's like in university and stuff, like you can learn so much more material so much faster because you're doing a lot of the learning on your own and you're going to the teachers for when you get stuck. But like these teachers that can inspire passion for a topic, I think that is one of the most invaluable skills in our whole species. Like, because if you can do that, then you, it's like AI, like AI is going to teach itself so much more efficiently than we can teach it. We just needed to get it to the point where it can teach itself. And then. It finds the motivation to do so, right? Yeah. So like you inspire it to do so. Yeah. And then it could teach itself. What do you make of the fact, you mentioned Rise and Fall of the Third Reich. I just. Have you read that? Yeah, I read it twice. You read it twice? Yes. Okay, so no one even knows what it is. Yeah. And I'm like, wait, I thought this was like a super poppin book. Super pop. Yeah, I'm not like that, I'm not that far in it. But it is, it's so interesting. Yeah, it's written by a person that was there, which is very important to kind of. You know, you start being like, how could this possibly happen? And then when you read Rise and Fall of the Third Reich, it's like, people tried really hard for this to not happen. People tried, they almost reinstated a monarchy at one point to try to stop this from happening. Like they almost like abandoned democracy to try to get this to not happen. At least the way it makes me feel is that there's a bunch of small moments on which history can turn. Yes. It's like small meetings. Yes. Human interactions. And it's both terrifying and inspiring because it's like, even just attempts at assassinating Hitler, like time and time again failed. And they were so close. Was it like Operation Valkyrie? Such a good. And then there's also the role of, that's a really heavy burden, which is from a geopolitical perspective, the role of leaders to see evil before it truly becomes evil, to anticipate it, to stand up to evil. Because evil is actually pretty rare in this world at a scale that Hitler was. We tend to, you know, in the modern discourse kind of call people evil too quickly. If you look at ancient history, like there was a ton of Hitlers. I actually think it's more the norm than, like again, going back to like my sort of intelligent design theory, I think one of the things we've been successfully doing in our slow move from survival of the fittest to intelligent design is we've kind of been eradicating, like if you look at like ancient Assyria and stuff, like that shit was like brutal and just like the heads on the, like brutal, like Genghis Khan just like genocide after genocide was like throwing plague bodies over the walls and decimating whole cities or like the Muslim conquests of like Damascus and shit. Just like people, cities used to get leveled all the fucking time. Okay, get into the Bronze Age collapse. It's basically, there was like almost like Roman level like society. Like there was like all over the world, like global trade, like everything was awesome through a mix of, I think a bit of climate change and then the development of iron because basically bronze could only come from this, the way to make bronze, like everything had to be funneled through this one Iranian mine. And so it's like, there was just this one supply chain and this is one of the things that makes me worried about supply chains and why I think we need to be so thoughtful about, I think our biggest issue with society right now, like the thing that is most likely to go wrong is probably supply chain collapse, because war, climate change, whatever, like anything that causes supply chain collapse, our population is too big to handle that. And like the thing that seems to cause Dark Ages is mass supply chain collapse. But the Bronze Age collapse happened like, it was sort of like this ancient collapse that happened where like literally like ancient Egypt, all these cities, everything just got like decimated, destroyed, abandoned cities, like hundreds of them. There was like a flourishing society, like we were almost coming to modernity and everything got leveled. And they had this mini Dark Ages, but it was just like, there's so little writing or recording from that time that like, there isn't a lot of information about the Bronze Age collapse, but it was basically equivalent to like medieval, the medieval Dark Ages. But it just happened, I don't know the years, but like thousands of years earlier. And then we sort of like recovered from the Bronze Age collapse, empire reemerged, writing and trade and everything reemerged. And then we of course had the more contemporary Dark Ages. And then over time, we've designed mechanism to lessen and lessen the capability for the destructive power centers to emerge. There's more recording about the more contemporary Dark Ages. So I think we have like a better understanding of how to avoid it, but I still think we're at high risk for it. I think that's one of the big risks right now. So the natural state of being for humans is for there to be a lot of Hitlers, which has gotten really good at making it hard for them to emerge. We've gotten better at collaboration and resisting the power, like authoritarians to come to power. We're trying to go country by country, like we're moving past this. We're kind of like slowly incrementally, like moving towards like not scary old school war stuff. And I think seeing it happen in some of the countries that at least nominally are like supposed to have moved past that, that's scary because it reminds us that it can happen like in the places that have moved supposedly, as hopefully moved past that. And possibly at a civilization level, like you said, supply chain collapse might make people resource constraint, might make people desperate, angry, hateful, violent, and drag us right back in. I mean, supply chain collapse is how, like the ultimate thing that caused the Middle Ages was supply chain collapse. It's like people, because people were reliant on a certain level of technology, like people, like you look at like Britain, like they had glass, like people had aqueducts, people had like indoor heating and cooling and like running water and like buy food from all over the world and trade and markets. Like people didn't know how to hunt and forage and gather. And so we're in a similar situation. We are not educated enough to survive without technology. So if we have a supply chain collapse that like limits our access to technology, there will be like massive starvation and violence and displacement and war. Like, you know, it's like, yeah. In my opinion, it's like the primary marker of like what a dark age is. Well, technology is kind of enabling us to be more resilient in terms of supply chain, in terms of, to all the different catastrophic events that happened to us. Although the pandemic has kind of challenged our preparedness for the catastrophic. What do you think is the coolest invention humans come up with? The wheel, fire, cooking meat. Computers. Computers. Freaking computers. Internet or computers? Which one? What do you think the? Previous technologies, I mean, may have even been more profound and moved us to a certain degree, but I think the computers are what make us homo tech now. I think this is what, it's a brain augmentation. And so it like allows for actual evolution. Like the computers accelerate the degree to which all the other technologies can also be accelerated. Would you classify yourself as a homo sapien or a homo techno? Definitely homo techno. So you're one of the earliest of the species. I think most of us are. Like, as I said, like, I think if you like looked at brain scans of us versus humans a hundred years ago, it would look very different. I think we are physiologically different. Just even the interaction with the devices has changed our brains. Well, and if you look at, a lot of studies are coming out to show that like, there's a degree of inherited memory. So some of these physiological changes in theory should be, we should be passing them on. So like that's, you know, that's not like a, an instance of physiological change that's gonna fizzle out. In theory, that should progress like to our offspring. Speaking of offspring, what advice would you give to a young person, like in high school, whether there be an artist, a creative, an engineer, any kind of career path, or maybe just life in general, how they can live a life they can be proud of? I think one of my big thoughts, and like, especially now having kids, is that I don't think we spend enough time teaching creativity. And I think creativity is a muscle like other things. And there's a lot of emphasis on, you know, learn how to play the piano. And then you can write a song or like learn the technical stuff. And then you can do a thing. But I think it's, like, I have a friend who's like world's greatest guitar player, like, you know, amazing sort of like producer, works with other people, but he's really sort of like, you know, he like engineers and records things and like does solos, but he doesn't really like make his own music. And I was talking to him and I was like, dude, you're so talented at music. Like, why don't you make music or whatever? And he was like, cause I got, I'm too old. I never learned the creative muscle. And it's like, you know, it's embarrassing. It's like learning the creative muscle takes a lot of failure. And it also sort of, if when you're being creative, you know, you're throwing paint at a wall and a lot of stuff will fail. So like part of it is like a tolerance for failure and humiliation. And that's somehow that's easier to develop when you're young or be persist through it when you're young. Everything is easier to develop when you're young. Yes. And the younger, the better. It could destroy you. I mean, that's the shitty thing about creativity. If, you know, failure could destroy you if you're not careful, but that's a risk worth taking. But also, but at a young age, developing a tolerance to failure is good. I fail all the time. Like I do stupid shit all the time. Like in public, in private, I get canceled for, I've make all kinds of mistakes, but I just like am very resilient about making mistakes. And so then like I do a lot of things that like other people wouldn't do. And like, I think my greatest asset is my creativity. And I like, I think pain, like tolerance to failure is just a super essential thing that should be taught before other things. Brilliant advice. Yeah, yeah. I wish everybody encouraged sort of failure more as opposed to kind of. Cause we like punish failure. We're like, no, like when we were teaching kids, we're like, no, that's wrong. Like that's, you know, like X keeps like will be like wrong. at the, because I, you know, when I met him, I came in all furious about Spotify and like I grilled him super hard. So I've got his answers here. But he was saying like at the sort of peak of the CD industry, there was like 20,000 artists making millions and millions of dollars. Like there was just like a very tiny kind of 1%. And Spotify has kind of democratized the industry because now I think he said there's about a million artists making a good living from Spotify. And when I heard that, I was like, honestly, I would rather make less money and have just like a decent living and have more artists be able to have that, even though I like, I wish it could include everyone, but. Yeah, that's really hard to argue with. YouTube is the same. It's YouTube's mission. They want to basically have as many creators as possible and make a living, some kind of living. And that's so hard to argue with. It's so hard. But I think there's better ways to do it. My manager, I actually wish he was here. Like I would have brought him up. My manager is building an app that can manage you. So it'll like help you organize your percentages and get your publishing and dah, dah, dah, dah, dah. So you can take out all the middlemen so you can have a much bigger, it'll just like automate it. So you can get. So automate the manager? Automate management, publishing, and legal, it can read, the app he's building can read your contract and like tell you about it. Because one of the issues with music right now, it's not that we're not getting paid enough, but it's that the art industry is filled with middlemen because artists are not good at business. And from the beginning, like Frank Sinatra, it's all mob stuff. Like it's the music industry is run by business people, not the artists and the artists really get very small cuts of like what they make. And so I think part of the reason I'm a technocrat, which I mean, your fans are gonna be technocrats. So no one's, they're not gonna be mad at me about this, but like my fans hate it when I say this kind of thing or the general public. They don't like technocrats. They don't like technocrats. Like when I watched Battle Angel Alita and they were like the Martian technocracy and I was like, yeah, Martian technocracy. And then they were like, and they're evil. And I was like, oh, okay. I was like, cause Martian technocracy sounds sick to me. Yeah, so your intuition as technocrats would create some kind of beautiful world. For example, what my manager's working on, if you can create an app that removes the need for a lawyer and then you could have smart contracts on the blockchain, removes the need for like management and organizing all this stuff, like can read your stuff and explain it to you, can collect your royalties, you know, like then the small amounts, the amount of money that you're getting from Spotify actually means a lot more and goes a lot farther. It can remove some of the bureaucracy, some of the inefficiencies that make life not as great as it could be. Yeah, I think the issue isn't that there's not enough. Like the issue is that there's inefficiency and I'm really into this positive sum mindset, you know, the win, win mindset of like, instead of, you know, fighting over the scraps, how do we make the, or worrying about scarcity, like instead of a scarcity mindset, why don't we just increase the efficiency and, you know, in that way. Expand the size of the pie. Let me ask you about experimentation. So you said, which is beautiful, being a musician is like having a conversation with all those that came before you. How much of creating music is like kind of having that conversation, trying to fit into the cultural trends and how much of it is like trying to, as much as possible, be an outsider and come up with something totally new. It's like when you're thinking, when you're experimenting, are you trying to be totally different, totally weird? Are you trying to fit in? Man, this is so hard because I feel like I'm kind of in the process of semi retiring from music, so this is like my old brain. Yeah, bring it from like the shelf, put it on the table for a couple minutes, we'll just poke it. I think it's a bit of both because I think forcing yourself to engage with new music is really great for neuroplasticity. Like I think, you know, as people, part of the reason music is marketed at young people is because young people are very neuroplastic. So like if you're 16 to like 23 or whatever, it's gonna be really easy for you to love new music. And if you're older than that, it gets harder and harder and harder. And I think one of the beautiful things about being a musician is I just constantly force myself to listen to new music and I think it keeps my brain really plastic. And I think this is a really good exercise. I just think everyone should do this. You listen to new music and you hate it, I think you should just keep, force yourself to like, okay, well why do people like it? And like, you know, make your brain form new neural pathways and be more open to change. That's really brilliant actually. Sorry to interrupt, but like that exercise is really amazing to sort of embrace change, embrace sort of practice neuroplasticity. Because like that's one of the things, you fall in love with a certain band and you just kind of stay with that for the rest of your life and then you never understand the modern music. That's a really good exercise. Most of the streaming on Spotify is like classic rock and stuff. Like new music makes up a very small chunk of what is played on Spotify. And I think this is like not a good sign for us as a species. I think, yeah. So it's a good measure of the species open mindedness to change is how often you listen to new music. The brain, let's put the music brain back on the shelf. I gotta pull out the futurist brain for a second. In what wild ways do you think the future, say in like 30 years, maybe 50 years, maybe a hundred years will be different from our current way of life on earth? We can talk about augmented reality, virtual reality, maybe robots, maybe space travel, maybe video games, maybe genetic engineering. I can keep going. Cyborgs, aliens, world wars, maybe destructive nuclear wars, good and bad. When you think about the future, what are you imagining? What's the weirdest and the wildest it could be? Have you read Surface Detail by Iain Banks? Surface Detail is my favorite depiction of a, oh wow, you have to read this book. It's literally the greatest science fiction book possibly ever written. Iain Banks is the man, yeah, for sure. What have you read? Just the Player of Games. I read that titles can't be copyrighted so you can just steal them. And I was like, Player of Games, sick. Nice. Yeah, so you can name your album. Like I always wanted to. Romeo and Juliet or something. I always wanted to name an album War and Peace. Nice. Like that would be, like you. That is a good, that's a good, where have I heard that before? You can do that, like you could do that. Also things that are in the public domain. For people who have no clue, you do have a song called Player of Games. Yes, oh yeah. So Iain Banks, Surface Detail is in my opinion the best future that I've ever read about or heard about in science fiction. Basically there's the relationship with super intelligence, like artificial super intelligence is just, it's like great. I want to credit the person who coined this term because I love this term. And I feel like young women don't get enough credit in. Yeah, so if you go to Protopia Futures on Instagram, what is her name? Personalized donor experience at scale, our AI power donor experience. Monica Bealskite, I'm saying that wrong. And I'm probably gonna, I'm probably butchering this a bit, but Protopia is sort of, if utopia is unattainable, Protopia is sort of like, you know. Wow, that's an awesome Instagram, Protopia Futures. A great, a future that is, you know, as good as we can get. The future, positive future. AI, is this a centralized AI in Surface Detail or is it distributed? What kind of AI is it? They mostly exist as giant super ships, like sort of like the guild ships in Dune. Like they're these giant ships that kind of move people around and the ships are sentient and they can talk to all the passengers. And I mean, there's a lot of different types of AI in the Banksyan future, but in the opening scene of Surface Detail, there's this place called the Culture and the Culture is basically a Protopian future. And a Protopian future, I think, is like a future that is like, obviously it's not utopia, it's not perfect. And like, cause like striving for utopia, I think feels hopeless and it's sort of like, maybe not the best terminology to be using. So it's like, it's a pretty good place. Like mostly like, you know, super intelligence and biological beings exist fairly in harmony. There's not too much war. There's like as close to equality as you can get, you know, it's like approximately a good future. Like there's really awesome stuff. It's, and in the opening scene, this girl, she's born as a sex slave outside of the culture. So she's in a society that doesn't adhere to the cultural values. She tries to kill the guy who is her like master, but he kills her, but unbeknownst to her, when she was traveling on a ship through the culture Like he'll say like crazy things. Like X keeps being like, like bubble car, bubble car. And I'm like, and you know, I'm like, what's a bubble car? Like, but like, it doesn't like, but I don't want to be like, no, you're wrong. I'm like, you're thinking of weird, crazy shit. Like, I don't know what a bubble car is, but like. It's creating worlds and they might be internally consistent. And through that, you might discover something fundamental about this world. Yeah, or he'll like rewrite songs, like with words that he prefers. So like, instead of baby shark, he says baby car. It's like. Maybe he's onto something. Let me ask the big, ridiculous question. We were kind of dancing around it, but what do you think is the meaning of this whole thing we have here of human civilization, of life on earth, but in general, just life? What's the meaning of life? C. Have you, did you read Nova Scene yet? By James Lovelock? You're doing a lot of really good book recommendations here. I haven't even finished this, so I'm a huge fraud yet again. But like really early in the book, he says this amazing thing. Like, I feel like everyone's so sad and cynical. Like everyone's like the Fermi paradox and everyone. I just keep hearing people being like, fuck, what if we're alone? Like, oh no, ah, like, ah, ah. And I'm like, okay, but like, wait, what if this is the beginning? Like in Nova Scene, he says, this is not gonna be a correct, I can't like memorize quotes, but he says something like, what if our consciousness, like right now, like this is the universe waking up? Like what if instead of discovering the universe, this is the universe, like this is the evolution of the literal universe herself. Like we are not separate from the universe. Like this is the universe waking up. This is the universe seeing herself for the first time. Like this is. The universe becoming conscious. The first time we were a part of that. Yeah, cause it's like, we aren't separate from the universe. Like this could be like an incredibly sacred moment and maybe like social media and all this things, the stuff where we're all getting connected together. Like maybe these are the neurons connecting of the like collective super intelligence that is, Waking up. The, yeah, like, you know, it's like, maybe instead of something cynical or maybe if there's something to discover, like maybe this is just, you know, we're a blast assist of like some incredible kind of consciousness or being. And just like in the first three years of life or for human children, we'll forget about all the suffering that we're going through now. I think we'll probably forget about this. I mean, probably, you know, artificial intelligence will eventually render us obsolete. I don't think they'll do it in a malicious way, but I think probably we are very weak. The sun is expanding. Like, I don't know, like, hopefully we can get to Mars, but like, we're pretty vulnerable. And I, you know, like, I think we can coexist for a long time with AI and we can also probably make ourselves less vulnerable, but, you know, I just think consciousness, sentience, self awareness, like, I think this might be the single greatest like moment in evolution ever. And like, maybe this is, you know, the big, like the true beginning of life. And we're just, we're the blue green algae or we're like the single celled organisms of something amazing. The universe awakens and this is it. Yeah. Well, see, you're an incredible person. You're a fascinating mind. You should definitely do, your friend Liv mentioned that you guys were thinking of maybe talking. I would love it if you explored your mind in this kind of media more and more by doing a podcast with her or just in any kind of way. So you're an awesome person. It's an honor to know you. It's an honor to get to sit down with you late at night, which is like surreal. And I really enjoyed it. Thank you for talking today. Yeah, no, I mean, huge honor. I feel very underqualified to be here, but I'm a big fan. I've been listening to the podcast a lot and yeah, me and Liv would appreciate any advice and help and we're definitely gonna do that. So yeah. Anytime. Thank you. Cool, thank you. Thanks for listening to this conversation with Grimes. To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now let me leave you with some words from Oscar Wilde. Yes, I'm a dreamer. For a dreamer is one who can only find her way by moonlight and her punishment is that she sees the dawn before the rest of the world. Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time. with him one day, a ship put a neural lace in her head and neural lace is sort of like, it's basically a Neuralink because life imitates art. It does indeed. It does indeed. So she wakes up and the opening scene is her memory has been uploaded by this neural lace when she has been killed. And now she gets to choose a new body. And this AI is interfacing with her recorded memory in her neural lace and helping her and being like, hello, you're dead. But because you had a neural lace, your memory's uploaded. Do you want to choose a new body? And you're going to be born here in the culture and like start a new life, which is just, that's like the opening. It's like so sick. And the ship is the super intelligence. All the ships are kind of super intelligence. But they still want to preserve a kind of rich, fulfilling experience for the humans. Yeah, like they're like friends with the humans. And then there's a bunch of ships that don't want to exist with biological beings, but they just have their own place like way over there. But they don't, they just do their own thing. They're not necessarily. So it's a pretty, this protopian existence is pretty peaceful. Yeah, I mean, and then, for example, one of the main fights in the book is they're fighting, there's these artificial hells that, and people don't think it's ethical to have artificial hell. Like basically when people do crime, they get sent, like when they die, their memory gets sent to an artificial hell and they're eternally tortured. And so, and then the way that society is deciding whether or not to have the artificial hell is that they're having these simulated, they're having like a simulated war. So instead of actual blood, you know, people are basically essentially fighting in a video game to choose the outcome of this. But they're still experiencing the suffering in this artificial hell or no? Can you experience stuff or? So the artificial hell sucks. And a lot of people in the culture want to get rid of the artificial hell. There's a simulated wars, are they happening in the artificial hell? So no, the simulated wars are happening outside of the artificial hell, between the political factions who are, so this political faction says we should have simulated hell to deter crime. And this political faction is saying, no, simulated hell is unethical. And so instead of like having, you know, blowing each other up with nukes, they're having like a giant Fortnite battle to decide this, which, you know, to me that's protopia. That's like, okay, we can have war without death. You know, I don't think there should be simulated hells. I think that is definitely one of the ways in which technology could go very, very, very, very wrong. So almost punishing people in a digital space or something like that. Yeah, like torturing people's memories. So either as a deterrent, like if you committed a crime, but also just for personal pleasure, if there's some sick, demented humans in this world. Dan Carlin actually has this episode of Hardcore History on painful attainment. Oh, that episode is fucked. It's dark, because he kind of goes through human history and says like, we as humans seem to enjoy, secretly enjoy or used to be openly enjoy sort of the torture and the death, watching the death and torture of other humans. I do think if people were consenting, we should be allowed to have gladiatorial matches. But consent is hard to achieve in those situations. It always starts getting slippery. Like it could be also forced consent, like it starts getting weird. There's way too much excitement. Like this is what he highlights. There's something about human nature that wants to see that violence. And it's really dark. And you hope that we can sort of overcome that aspect of human nature, but that's still within us somewhere. Well, I think that's what we're doing right now. I have this theory that what is very important about the current moment is that all of evolution has been survival of the fittest up until now. And at some point, the lines are kind of fuzzy, but in the recent past, or maybe even just right now, we're getting to this point where we can choose intelligent design. Like we probably since like the integration of the iPhone, like we are becoming cyborgs. Like our brains are fundamentally changed. Everyone who grew up with electronics, we are fundamentally different from previous, from homo sapiens. I call us homo techno. I think we have evolved into homo techno, which is like essentially a new species. Like if you look at the way, if you took an MRI of my brain and you took an MRI of like a medieval brain, I think it would be very different the way that it has evolved. Do you think when historians look back at this time, they'll see like this was a fundamental shift to what a human being is? I think, I do not think we are still homo sapiens. I believe we are homo techno. And I think we have evolved. And I think right now, the way we are evolving, we can choose how we do that. And I think we are being very reckless about how we're doing that. Like we're just having social media, but I think this idea that like this is a time to choose intelligent design should be taken very seriously. It like now is the moment to reprogram the human computer. It's like, if you go blind, your visual cortex will get taken over with other functions. We can choose our own evolution. We can change the way our brains work. And so we actually have a huge responsibility to do that. And I think I'm not sure who should be responsible for that, but there's definitely not adequate education. We're being inundated with all this technology that is fundamentally changing the physical structure of our brains. And we are not adequately responding to that to choose how we wanna evolve. And we could evolve, we could be really whatever we want. And I think this is a really important time. And I think if we choose correctly and we choose wisely, consciousness could exist for a very long time and integration with AI could be extremely positive. And I don't think enough people are focusing on this specific situation. Do you think we might irreversibly screw things up if we get things wrong now? Because the flip side of that, it seems humans are pretty adaptive. So maybe the way we figure things out is by screwing it up, like social media. Over a generation, we'll see the negative effects of social media, and then we build new social medias, and we just keep improving stuff. And then we learn from the failures of the past. Because humans seem to be really adaptive. On the flip side, we can get it wrong in a way where literally we create weapons of war or increase hate. Past a certain threshold, we really do a lot of damage. I mean, I think we're optimized to notice the negative things. But I would actually say one of the things that I think people aren't noticing is if you look at Silicon Valley and you look at the technocracy, like what's been happening there. When Silicon Valley started, it was all just Facebook and all this for profit crap that really wasn't particular. I guess it was useful, but it's sort of just whatever. But now you see lab grown meat, compostable, or biodegradable, single use cutlery, or meditation apps. I think we are actually evolving and changing, and technology is changing. I think there just maybe there isn't quite enough education about this. And also, I don't know if there's quite enough incentive for it because I think the way capitalism works, what we define as profit, we're also working on an old model of what we define as profit. I really think if we changed the idea of profit to include social good, you can have economic profit, social good also counting as profit would incentivize things that are more useful and more whatever spiritual technology or positive technology or things that help reprogram a human computer in a good way or things that help us intelligently design our new brains. Yeah, there's no reason why within the framework of capitalism, the word profit or the idea of profit can't also incorporate the well being of a human being. So like long term well being, long term happiness. Or even for example, we were talking about motherhood, like part of the reason I'm so late is because I had to get the baby to bed. And it's like, I keep thinking about motherhood, how under capitalism, it's like this extremely essential job that is very difficult that is not compensated. And we sort of like value things by how much we compensate them. And so we really devalue motherhood in our society and pretty much all societies. Like capitalism does not recognize motherhood. It's just a job that you're supposed to do for free. And it's like, but I feel like producing great humans should be seen as a great, as profit under capitalism. Like that should be, that's like a huge social good. Like every awesome human that gets made adds so much to the world. So like if that was integrated into the profit structure, then, you know, and if we potentially found a way to compensate motherhood. So come up with a compensation that's much broader than just money or. Or it could just be money. Like, what if you just made, I don't know, but I don't know how you'd pay for that. Like, I mean, that's where you start getting into. Reallocation of resources that people get upset over. Well, like what if we made like a motherhood Dow? Yeah, yeah. And, you know, used it to fund like single mothers, like, you know, pay for making babies. So, I mean, if you create and put beautiful things onto the world, that could be companies, that can be bridges, that could be art, that could be a lot of things, and that could be children, which are. Or education or. Anything, that should be valued by society, and that should be somehow incorporated into the framework of what, as a market, of what. Like, if you contribute children to this world, that should be valued and respected and sort of celebrated, like, proportional to what it is, which is, it's the thing that fuels human civilization. Yeah, like I. It's kind of important. I feel like everyone's always saying, I mean, I think we're in very different social spheres, but everyone's always saying, like, dismantle capitalism. And I'm like, well, okay, well, I don't think the government should own everything. Like, I don't think we should not have private ownership. Like, that's scary. You know, like that starts getting into weird stuff and just sort of like, I feel there's almost no way to do that without a police state, you know? But obviously, capitalism has some major flaws. And I think actually Mac showed me this idea called social capitalism, which is a form of capitalism that just like considers social good to be also profit. Like, you know, it's like, right now companies need to, like, you're supposed to grow every quarter or whatever to like show that you're functioning well, but it's like, okay, well, what if you kept the same amount of profit? You're still in the green, but then you have also all this social good. Like, do you really need all this extra economic growth or could you add this social good and that counts? And, you know, I don't know if, I am not an economist. I have no idea how this could be achieved, but. I don't think economists know how anything could be achieved either, but they pretend. It's the thing, they construct a model and they go on TV shows and sound like an expert. That's the definition of economist. How did being a mother, becoming a mother change you as a human being, would you say? Man, I think it kind of changed everything and it's still changing me a lot. It's actually changing me more right now in this moment than it was before. Like today, like this? Just like in the most recent months and stuff. Can you elucidate that, how change, like when you wake up in the morning and you look at yourself, it's again, which, who are you? How have you become different, would you say? I think it's just really reorienting my priorities. And at first I was really fighting against that because I somehow felt it was like a failure of feminism or something. Like I felt like it was like bad if like my kids started mattering more than my work. And then like more recently I started sort of analyzing that thought in myself and being like, that's also kind of a construct. It's like, we've just devalued motherhood so much in our culture that like, I feel guilty for caring about my kids more than I care about my work. So feminism includes breaking out of whatever the construct is. So just continually breaking, it's like freedom empower you to be free. And that means... But it also, but like being a mother, like I'm so much more creative. Like I cannot believe the massive amount of brain growth that I am. Why do you think that is? Just cause like the stakes are higher somehow? I think it's like, it's just so trippy watching consciousness emerge. It's just like, it's like going on a crazy journey or something. It's like the craziest science fiction novel you could ever read. It's just so crazy watching consciousness come into being. And then at the same time, like you're forced to value your time so much. Like when I have creative time now, it's so sacred. I need to like be really fricking on it. But the other thing is that I used to just be like a cynic and I used to just wanna... Like my last album was called Miss Anthropocene and it was like this like, it was like a study in villainy or like it was like, well, what if we have, instead of the old gods, we have like new gods and it's like Miss Anthropocene is like misanthrope like and Anthropocene, which is like the, you know, like and she's the goddess of climate change or whatever. And she's like destroying the world. And it was just like, it was like dark and it was like a study in villainy. And it was sort of just like, like I used to like have no problem just making cynical, angry, scary art. And not that there's anything wrong with that, but I think having kids just makes you such an optimist. It just inherently makes you wanna be an optimist so bad that like I feel more responsibility to make more optimistic things. And I get a lot of shit for it because everyone's like, oh, you're so privileged. Stop talking about like pie in the sky, stupid concepts and focus on like the now. But it's like, I think if we don't ideate about futures that could be good, we won't be able to get them. If everything is Blade Runner, then we're gonna end up with Blade Runner. It's like, as we said earlier, life imitates art. Like life really does imitate art. And so we really need more protopian or utopian art. I think this is incredibly essential for the future of humanity. And I think the current discourse where that's seen as a thinking about protopia or utopia is seen as a dismissal of the problems that we currently have. I think that is an incorrect mindset. And like having kids just makes me wanna imagine amazing futures that like maybe I won't be able to build, but they will be able to build if they want to. Yeah, it does seem like ideation is a precursor to creation. So you have to imagine it in order to be able to build it. And there is a sad thing about human nature that somehow a cynical view of the world is seen as a insightful view. You know, cynicism is often confused for insight, which is sad to see. And optimism is confused for naivete. Yes, yes. Like you don't, you're blinded by your, maybe your privilege or whatever. You're blinded by something, but you're certainly blinded. That's sad, that's sad to see because it seems like the optimists are the ones that create our future. They're the ones that build. In order to build the crazy thing, you have to be optimistic. You have to be either stupid or excited or passionate or mad enough to actually believe that it can be built. And those are the people that built it. My favorite quote of all time is from Star Wars, Episode 8, which I know everyone hates. Do you like Star Wars, Episode 8? No, yeah, probably I would say I would probably hate it, yeah. I don't have strong feelings about it. Let me backtrack. I don't have strong feelings about Star Wars. I'm a Tolkien person. I'm more into dragons and orcs and ogres. Yeah, I mean, Tolkien forever. I really want to have one more son and call him, I thought Tao Tecno Tolkien would be cool. It's a lot of T's, I like it. Yeah, and well, and Tao is six, two, eight, two pi. Yeah, Tao Tecno, yeah, yeah, yeah. And then techno is obviously the best genre of music, but also like technocracy. It just sounds really good. Yeah, that's right, and techno Tolkien, Tao Tecno Tolkien. That's a good, that's it. Tao Tecno Tolkien, but Star Wars, Episode 8, I know a lot of people have issues with it. Personally, on the record, I think it's the best Star Wars film. You're starting trouble today. Yeah, but don't kill what you hate, save what you love. Don't kill what you hate. Don't kill what you hate, save what you love. And I think we're, in society right now, we're in a diagnosis mode. We're just diagnosing and diagnosing and diagnosing, and we're trying to kill what we hate, and we're not trying to save what we love enough. And there's this Buckminster Fuller quote, which I'm gonna butcher, because I don't remember it correctly, but it's something along the lines of, don't try to destroy the old bad models, render them obsolete with better models. Maybe we don't need to destroy the oil industry. Maybe we just create a great new battery technology and sustainable transport, and just make it economically unreasonable to still continue to rely on fossil fuels. It's like, don't kill what you hate, save what you love. Make new things and just render the old things unusable. It's like if the college debt is so bad, and universities are so expensive, and I feel like education is becoming obsolete. I feel like we could completely revolutionize education, and we could make it free. And it's like, you look at JSTOR, and you have to pay to get all the studies and everything. What if we created a DAO that bought JSTOR, or we created a DAO that was funding studies, and those studies were open source, or free for everyone. And what if we just open sourced education and decentralized education and made it free, and all research was on the internet, and all the outcomes of studies were on the internet, and no one has student debt, and you just take tests when you apply for a job, and if you're qualified, then you can work there. This is just like, I don't know how anything works. I'm just randomly ranting, but. I like the humility. You gotta think from just basic first principles. What is the problem? What's broken? What are some ideas? That's it. And get excited about those ideas, and share your excitement, and don't tear each other down. It's just when you kill things, you often end up killing yourself. Like war is not a one sided, like you're not gonna go in and just kill them, like you're gonna get stabbed. It's like, and I think when I talk about this nexus point of that we're in this point in society where we're switching to intelligent design, I think part of our switch to intelligent design is that we need to choose nonviolence. And we need to, like, I think we can choose to start, I don't think we can eradicate violence from our species, because I think we need it a little bit, but I think we can choose to really reorient our primitive brains that are fighting over scarcity, and that are so attack oriented, and move into, we can optimize for creativity and building. Yeah, it's interesting to think how that happens, so some of it is just education, some of it is living life and introspecting your own mind, and trying to live up to the better angels of your nature for each one of us, all those kinds of things at scale. That's how we can sort of start to minimize the amount of destructive war in our world, and that's, to me, probably you're the same, technology is a really promising way to do that. Like, social media should be a really promising way to do that, it's a way we connect. I, you know, for the most part, I really enjoy social media. I just know all the negative stuff. I don't engage with any of the negative stuff. Just not even, like, by blocking or any of that kind of stuff, but just not letting it enter my mind. Like, just, like, when somebody says something negative, I see it, I immediately think positive thoughts about them, and I just forget they exist after that. Just move on, because, like, that negative energy, if I return the negative energy, they're going to get excited in a negative way right back, and it's just this kind of vicious cycle. But you would think technology would assist us in this process of letting go, of not taking things personally, of not engaging in the negativity, but unfortunately, social media profits from the negativity, so the current models. I mean, social media is like a gun. Like, you should take a course before you use it. Like, it's like, this is what I mean, like, when I say reprogram the human computer. Like, in school, you should learn about how social media optimizes to, you know, raise your cortisol levels and make you angry and crazy and stressed, and, like, you should learn how to have hygiene about how you use social media. But, so you can, yeah, choose not to focus on the negative stuff, but I don't know. I'm not sure social media should, I guess it should exist. I'm not sure. I mean, we're in the messy, it's the experimental phase. Like, we're working it out. Yeah, it's the early days. I don't even know, when you say social media, I don't know what that even means. We're in the very early days. I think social media is just basic human connection in the digital realm, and that, I think it should exist, but there's so many ways to do it in a bad way. There's so many ways to do it in a good way. There's all discussions of all the same human rights. We talk about freedom of speech. We talk about sort of violence in the space of digital media. We talk about hate speech. We talk about all these things that we had to figure out back in the day in the physical space. We're now figuring out in the digital space, and it's like baby stages. When the printing press came out, it was like pure chaos for a minute, you know? It's like when you inject, when there's a massive information injection into the general population, there's just gonna be, I feel like the printing press, I don't have the years, but it was like printing press came out, shit got really fucking bad for a minute, but then we got the enlightenment. And so it's like, I think we're in, this is like the second coming of the printing press. We're probably gonna have some shitty times for a minute, and then we're gonna have recalibrate to have a better understanding of how we consume media and how we deliver media. Speaking of programming the human computer, you mentioned Baby X. So there's this young consciousness coming to be, came from a cell. Like that whole thing doesn't even make sense. It came from DNA. Yeah. And then there's this baby computer that just like grows and grows and grows and grows, and now there's a conscious being with extremely impressive cognitive capabilities with, Have you met him? Yes, yeah. Yeah. He's actually really smart. He's really smart. Yeah. He's weird. Yeah. Or a baby. He does. I don't, I haven't. I don't know a lot of other babies, but he seems to be smart. Zach, I don't hang out with babies often, but this baby was very impressive. He does a lot of pranks and stuff. Oh, so he's like. Like he'll like give you a treat and then take it away and laugh and like stuff like that. So he's like a chess player. So here's a cognitive sort of, there's a computer being programmed. So he's taking in the environment, interacting with a specific set of humans. How would you, first of all, what is it? What, let me ask. I want to ask how do you program this computer? And also how do you make sense of that there's a conscious being right there that wasn't there before? It's giving me a lot of crisis thoughts. I'm thinking really hard. I think that's part of the reason it's like, I'm struggling to focus on art and stuff right now. Cause baby X is becoming conscious and like my it's just reorienting my brain. Like my brain is suddenly totally shifting of like, oh shit, like the way we raise children. Like, I hate all the baby books and everything. I hate them. Like they're, oh, the art is so bad. And like all this stuff, everything about all the aesthetics. And like, I'm just like, ah, like this is so. The programming languages we're using to program these baby computers isn't good. Yeah, like I'm thinking, and I, not that I have like good answers or know what to do, but I'm just thinking really, really hard about it. I, we recently watched Totoro with him, Studio Ghibli. And it's just like a fantastic film. And he like responded to, I know you're not supposed to show baby screens too much, but like, I think it's the most sort of like, I feel like it's the highest art baby content. Like it really speaks, there's almost no talking in it. It's really simple. Although all the dialogue is super, super, super simple, you know, and it's like a one to three year old can like really connect with it. Like it feels like it's almost aimed at like a one to three year old, but it's like great art and it's so imaginative and it's so beautiful. And like the first time I showed it to him, he was just like so invested in it, unlike I've ever, unlike anything else I'd ever shown him. Like he was just like crying when they cry and laughing when they laugh, like just like having this roller coaster of like emotions, like, and he learned a bunch of words. Like he was, and he started saying Totoro and started just saying all this stuff after watching Totoro, and he wants to watch it all the time. And I was like, man, why isn't there an industry of this? Like why aren't our best artists focusing on making art like for the birth of consciousness? Like, and that's one of the things I've been thinking I really wanna start doing. You know, I don't wanna speak before I do things too much, but like, I'm just like ages one to three, like we should be putting so much effort into that. And the other thing about Totoro is it's like, it's like better for the environment because adults love Totoro. It's such good art that everyone loves it. Like I still have all my old Totoro merch from when I was a kid. Like I literally have the most ragged old Totoro merch. Like everybody loves it, everybody keeps it. It's like, why does the art we have for babies need to suck and be not accessible to adults and then just be thrown out when, you know, they age out of it? Like, it's like, I don't know. I don't have like a fully formed thought here, but this is just something I've been thinking about a lot is like, how do we like, how do we have more Totoroesque content? Like how do we have more content like this that like is universal and everybody loves, but is like really geared to an emerging consciousness? Emerging consciousness in the first like three years of life that so much turmoil, so much evolution of mind is happening. It seems like a crucial time. Would you say to make it not suck, do you think of basically treating a child like they have the capacity to have the brilliance of an adult or even beyond that? Is that how you think of that mind or? No, cause they still, they like it when you talk weird and stuff. Like they respond better to, cause even they can imitate better when your voice is higher. Like people say like, oh, don't do baby talk. But it's like, when your voice is higher, it's closer to something they can imitate. So they like, like the baby talk actually kind of works. Like it helps them learn to communicate. I've found it to be more effective with learning words and stuff. But like, you're not speaking down to them. Like do they have the capacity\",\n          \"The following is a conversation with Sean Carroll. He's a theoretical physicist at Caltech specializing in quantum mechanics, gravity, and cosmology. He's the author of several popular books, one on the arrow of time called From Eternity to Here, one on the Higgs boson called Particle at the End of the Universe, and one on science and philosophy called The Big Picture on the Origins of Life, Meaning, and the Universe Itself. He has an upcoming book on quantum mechanics that you can preorder now called Something Deeply Hidden. He writes one of my favorite blogs on his website, preposterousuniverse.com. I recommend clicking on the Greatest Hits link that lists accessible, interesting posts on the arrow of time, dark matter, dark energy, the Big Bang, general relativity, string theory, quantum mechanics, and the big meta questions about the philosophy of science, God, ethics, politics, academia, and much, much more. Finally, and perhaps most famously, he's the host of a podcast called Mindscape that you should subscribe to and support on Patreon. Along with the Joe Rogan experience, Sam Harris's Making Sense, and Dan Carlin's Hardcore History, Sean's Mindscape podcast is one of my favorite ways to learn new ideas or explore different perspectives and ideas that I thought I understood. It was truly an honor to meet and spend a couple hours with Sean. It's a bit heartbreaking to say that for the first time ever, the audio recorder for this podcast died in the middle of our conversation. There's technical reasons for this, having to do with phantom power that I now understand and will avoid. It took me one hour to notice and fix the problem. So, much like the universe is 68% dark energy, roughly the same amount from this conversation was lost, except in the memories of the two people involved and in my notes. I'm sure we'll talk again and continue this conversation on this podcast or on Sean's. And of course, I look forward to it. This is the Artificial Intelligence podcast. If you enjoy it, subscribe on YouTube, iTunes, support it on Patreon, or simply connect with me on Twitter at Lex Friedman. And now, here's my conversation with Sean Carroll. What do you think is more interesting and impactful, understanding how the universe works at a fundamental level or understanding how the human mind works? You know, of course this is a crazy, meaningless, unanswerable question in some sense, because they're both very interesting and there's no absolute scale of interestingness that we can rate them on. There's a glib answer that says the human brain is part of the universe, right? And therefore, understanding the universe is more fundamental than understanding the human brain. But do you really believe that once we understand the fundamental way the universe works at the particle level, the forces, we would be able to understand how the mind works? No, certainly not. We cannot understand how ice cream works just from understanding how particles work, right? So I'm a big believer in emergence. I'm a big believer that there are different ways of talking about the world beyond just the most fundamental microscopic one. You know, when we talk about tables and chairs and planets and people, we're not talking the language of particle physics and cosmology. So, but understanding the universe, you didn't say just at the most fundamental level, right? So understanding the universe at all levels is part of that. I do think, you know, to be a little bit more fair to the question, there probably are general principles of complexity, biology, information processing, memory, knowledge, creativity that go beyond just the human brain, right? And maybe one could count understanding those as part of understanding the universe. The human brain, as far as we know, is the most complex thing in the universe. So there's, it's certainly absurd to think that by understanding the fundamental laws of particle physics, you get any direct insight on how the brain works. But then there's this step from the fundamentals of particle physics to information processing, which a lot of physicists and philosophers may be a little bit carelessly take when they talk about artificial intelligence. Do you think of the universe as a kind of a computational device? No, to be like, the honest answer there is no. There's a sense in which the universe processes information, clearly. There's a sense in which the universe is like a computer, clearly. But in some sense, I think, I tried to say this once on my blog and no one agreed with me, but the universe is more like a computation than a computer because the universe happens once. A computer is a general purpose machine, right? That you can ask it different questions, even a pocket calculator, right? And it's set up to answer certain kinds of questions. The universe isn't that. So information processing happens in the universe, but it's not what the universe is. And I know your MIT colleague, Seth Lloyd, feels very differently about this, right? Well, you're thinking of the universe as a closed system. I am. So what makes a computer more like a PC, like a computing machine is that there's a human that every once comes up to it and moves the mouse around. So input. Gives it input. Gives it input. And that's why you're saying it's just a computation, a deterministic thing that's just unrolling. But the immense complexity of it is nevertheless like processing. There's a state and then it changes with good rules. And there's a sense for a lot of people that if the brain operates, the human brain operates within that world, then it's simply just a small subset of that. And so there's no reason we can't build arbitrarily great intelligences. Yeah. Do you think of intelligence in this way? Intelligence is tricky. I don't have a definition of it offhand. So I remember this panel discussion that I saw on YouTube. I wasn't there, but Seth Lloyd was on the panel. And so was Martin Rees, the famous astrophysicist. And Seth gave his shtick for why the universe is a computer and explained this. And Martin Rees said, so what is not a computer? And Seth was like, oh, that's a good question. I'm not sure. Because if you have a sufficiently broad definition of what a computer is, then everything is, right? And the simile or the analogy gains force when it excludes some things. You know, is the moon going around the earth performing a computation? I can come up with definitions in which the answer is yes, but it's not a very useful computation. I think that it's absolutely helpful to think about the universe in certain situations, certain contexts, as an information processing device. I'm even guilty of writing a paper called Quantum Circuit Cosmology, where we modeled the whole universe as a quantum circuit. As a circuit. As a circuit, yeah. With qubits kind of thing? With qubits basically, right, yeah. So, and qubits becoming more and more entangled. So do we wanna digress a little bit? Let's do it. It's kind of fun. So here's a mystery about the universe that is so deep and profound that nobody talks about it. Space expands, right? And we talk about, in a certain region of space, a certain number of degrees of freedom, a certain number of ways that the quantum fields and the particles in that region can arrange themselves. That number of degrees of freedom in a region of space is arguably finite. We actually don't know how many there are, but there's a very good argument that says it's a finite number. So as the universe expands and space gets bigger, are there more degrees of freedom? If it's an infinite number, it doesn't really matter. Infinity times two is still infinity. But if it's a finite number, then there's more space, so there's more degrees of freedom. So where did they come from? That would mean the universe is not a closed system. There's more degrees of freedom popping into existence. So what we suggested was that there are more degrees of freedom, and it's not that they're not there to start, but they're not entangled to start. So the universe that you and I know of, the three dimensions around us that we see, we said those are the entangled degrees of freedom making up space time. And as the universe expands, there are a whole bunch of qubits in their zero state that become entangled with the rest of space time through the action of these quantum circuits. So what does it mean that there's now more degrees of freedom as they become more entangled? Yeah, so. As the universe expands. That's right, so there's more and more degrees of freedom that are entangled, that are playing part, playing the role of part of the entangled space time structure. So the basic, the underlying philosophy is that space time itself arises from the entanglement of some fundamental quantum degrees of freedom. Wow, okay, so at which point is most of the entanglement happening? Are we talking about close to the Big Bang? Are we talking about throughout the time of the life? Throughout history, yeah. So the idea is that at the Big Bang, almost all the degrees of freedom that the universe could have were there, but they were unentangled with anything else. And that's a reflection of the fact that the Big Bang had a low entropy. It was a very simple, very small place. And as space expands, more and more degrees of freedom become entangled with the rest of the world. Well, I have to ask John Carroll, what do you think of the thought experiment from Nick Bostrom that we're living in a simulation? So I think, let me contextualize that a little bit more. I think people don't actually take this thought experiments. I think it's quite interesting. It's not very useful, but it's quite interesting. From the perspective of AI, a lot of the learning that can be done usually happens in simulation from artificial examples. And so it's a constructive question to ask, how difficult is our real world to simulate? Right. Which is kind of a dual part of, if we're living in a simulation and somebody built that simulation, if you were to try to do it yourself, how hard would it be? So obviously we could be living in a simulation. If you just want the physical possibility, then I completely agree that it's physically possible. I don't think that we actually are. So take this one piece of data into consideration. You know, we live in a big universe, okay? There's two trillion galaxies in our observable universe with 200 billion stars in each galaxy, et cetera. It would seem to be a waste of resources to have a universe that big going on just to do a simulation. So in other words, I want to be a good Bayesian. I want to ask under this hypothesis, what do I expect to see? So the first thing I would say is I wouldn't expect to see a universe that was that big, okay? The second thing is I wouldn't expect the resolution of the universe to be as good as it is. So it's always possible that if our superhuman simulators only have finite resources, that they don't render the entire universe, right? That the part that is out there, the two trillion galaxies, isn't actually being simulated fully, okay? But then the obvious extrapolation of that is that only I am being simulated fully. Like the rest of you are just non player characters, right? I'm the only thing that is real. The rest of you are just chat bots. Beyond this wall, I see the wall, but there is literally nothing on the other side of the wall. That is sort of the Bayesian prediction. That's what it would be like to do an efficient simulation of me. So like none of that seems quite realistic. I don't see, I hear the argument that it's just possible and easy to simulate lots of things. I don't see any evidence from what we know about our universe that we look like a simulated universe. Now, maybe you can say, well, we don't know what it would look like, but that's just abandoning your Bayesian responsibilities. Like your job is to say under this theory, here's what you would expect to see. Yeah, so certainly if you think about simulation as a thing that's like a video game where only a small subset is being rendered. But say the entire, all the laws of physics, the entire closed system of the quote unquote universe, it had a creator. Yeah, it's always possible. Right, so that's not useful to think about when you're thinking about physics. The way Nick Bostrom phrases it, if it's possible to simulate a universe, eventually we'll do it. Right. You can use that by the way for a lot of things. Well, yeah. But I guess the question is, how hard is it to create a universe? I wrote a little blog post about this and maybe I'm missing something, but there's an argument that says not only that it might be possible to simulate a universe, but probably if you imagine that you actually attribute consciousness and agency to the little things that we're simulating, to our little artificial beings, there's probably a lot more of them than there are ordinary organic beings in the universe or there will be in the future, right? So there's an argument that not only is being a simulation possible, it's probable because in the space of all living consciousnesses, most of them are being simulated, right? Most of them are not at the top level. I think that argument must be wrong because it follows from that argument that, if we're simulated, but we can also simulate other things, well, but if we can simulate other things, they can simulate other things, right? If we give them enough power and resolution and ultimately we'll reach a bottom because the laws of physics in our universe have a bottom, we're made of atoms and so forth, so there will be the cheapest possible simulations. And if you believe the original argument, you should conclude that we should be in the cheapest possible simulation because that's where most people are. But we don't look like that. It doesn't look at all like we're at the edge of resolution, that we're 16 bit things. It seems much easier to make much lower level things than we are. And also, I questioned the whole approach to the anthropic principle that says we are typical observers in the universe. I think that that's not actually, I think that there's a lot of selection that we can do that we're typical within things we already know, but not typical within all of the universe. So do you think there's intelligent life, however you would like to define intelligent life, out there in the universe? My guess is that there is not intelligent life in the observable universe other than us, simply on the basis of the fact that the likely number of other intelligent species in the observable universe, there's two likely numbers, zero or billions. And if there had been billions, you would have noticed already. For there to be literally like a small number, like, you know, Star Trek, there's a dozen intelligent civilizations in our galaxy, but not a billion, that's weird. That's sort of bizarre to me. It's easy for me to imagine that there are zero others because there's just a big bottleneck to making multicellular life or technological life or whatever. It's very hard for me to imagine that there's a whole bunch out there that have somehow remained hidden from us. The question I'd like to ask is what would intelligent life look like? What I mean by that question and where it's going is what if intelligent life is just in some very big ways different than the one that has on Earth? That there's all kinds of intelligent life that operates at different scales of both size and temporal. Right, that's a great possibility because I think we should be humble about what intelligence is, what life is. We don't even agree on what life is, much less what intelligent life is, right? So that's an argument for humility, saying there could be intelligent life of a very different character, right? Like you could imagine the dolphins are intelligent but never invent space travel because they live in the ocean and they don't have thumbs, right? So they never invent technology, they never invent smelting. Maybe the universe is full of intelligent species that just don't make technology, right? That's compatible with the data, I think. And I think maybe what you're pointing at is even more out there versions of intelligence, intelligence in intermolecular clouds or on the surface of a neutron star or in between the galaxies in giant things where the equivalent of a heartbeat is 100 million years. On the one hand, yes, we should be very open minded about those things. On the other hand, all of us share the same laws of physics. There might be something about the laws of physics, even though we don't currently know exactly what that thing would be, that makes meters and years the right length and timescales for intelligent life. Maybe not, but we're made of atoms, atoms have a certain size, we orbit stars or stars have a certain lifetime. It's not impossible to me that there's a sweet spot for intelligent life that we find ourselves in. So I'm open minded either way, I'm open minded either being humble and there's all sorts of different kinds of life or no, there's a reason we just don't know it yet why life like ours is the kind of life that's out there. Yeah, I'm of two minds too, but I often wonder if our brains is just designed to quite obviously to operate and see the world in these timescales and we're almost blind and the tools we've created for detecting things are blind to the kind of observation needed to see intelligent life at other scales. Well, I'm totally open to that, but so here's another argument I would make, we have looked for intelligent life, but we've looked at for it in the dumbest way we can, by turning radio telescopes to the sky. And why in the world would a super advanced civilization randomly beam out radio signals wastefully in all directions into the universe? That just doesn't make any sense, especially because in order to think that you would actually contact another civilization, you would have to do it forever, you have to keep doing it for millions of years, that sounds like a waste of resources. If you thought that there were other solar systems with planets around them, where maybe intelligent life didn't yet exist, but might someday, you wouldn't try to talk to it with radio waves, you would send a spacecraft out there and you would park it around there and it would be like, from our point of view, it'd be like 2001, where there was a monolith. Monolith. There could be an artifact, in fact, the other way works also, right? There could be artifacts in our solar system that have been put there by other technologically advanced civilizations and that's how we will eventually contact them. We just haven't explored the solar system well enough yet to find them. The reason why we don't think about that is because we're young and impatient, right? Like, it would take more than my lifetime to actually send something to another star system and wait for it and then come back. So, but if we start thinking on hundreds of thousands of years or million year time scales, that's clearly the right thing to do. Are you excited by the thing that Elon Musk is doing with SpaceX in general? Space, but the idea of space exploration, even though your, or your species is young and impatient? Yeah. No, I do think that space travel is crucially important, long term. Even to other star systems. And I think that many people overestimate the difficulty because they say, look, if you travel 1% the speed of light to another star system, we'll be dead before we get there, right? And I think that it's much easier. And therefore, when they write their science fiction stories, they imagine we'd go faster than the speed of light because otherwise they're too impatient, right? We're not gonna go faster than the speed of light, but we could easily imagine that the human lifespan gets extended to thousands of years. And once you do that, then the stars are much closer effectively, right? And then what's a hundred year trip, right? So I think that that's gonna be the future, the far future, not my lifetime once again, but baby steps. Unless your lifetime gets extended. Well, it's in a race against time, right? A friend of mine who actually thinks about these things said, you know, you and I are gonna die, but I don't know about our grandchildren. That's, I don't know, predicting the future is hard, but that's at least a plausible scenario. And so, yeah, no, I think that as we discussed earlier, there are threats to the earth, known and unknown, right? Having spread humanity and biology elsewhere is a really important longterm goal. What kind of questions can science not currently answer, but might soon? When you think about the problems and the mysteries before us that may be within reach of science. I think an obvious one is the origin of life. We don't know how that happened. There's a difficulty in knowing how it happened historically actually, you know, literally on earth, but starting life from non life is something I kind of think we're close to, right? We're really. You really think so? Like how difficult is it to start life? Well, I've talked to people, including on the podcast about this. You know, life requires three things. Life as we know it. So there's a difference with life, which who knows what it is, and life as we know it, which we can talk about with some intelligence. So life as we know it requires compartmentalization. You need like a little membrane around your cell. Metabolism, you need to take in food and eat it and let that make you do things. And then replication, okay? So you need to have some information about who you are that you pass down to future generations. In the lab, compartmentalization seems pretty easy. Not hard to make lipid bilayers that come into little cellular walls pretty easily. Metabolism and replication are hard, but replication we're close to. People have made RNA like molecules in the lab that I think the state of the art is, they're not able to make one molecule that reproduces itself, but they're able to make two molecules that reproduce each other. So that's okay. That's pretty close. Metabolism is harder, believe it or not, even though it's sort of the most obvious thing, but you want some sort of controlled metabolism and the actual cellular machinery in our bodies is quite complicated. It's hard to see it just popping into existence all by itself. It probably took a while, but we're making progress. And in fact, I don't think we're spending nearly enough money on it. If I were the NSF, I would flood this area with money because it would change our view of the world if we could actually make life in the lab and understand how it was made originally here on earth. And I'm sure it'd have some ripple effects that help cure disease and so on. I mean, just that understanding. So synthetic biology is a wonderful big frontier where we're making cells. Right now, the best way to do that is to borrow heavily from existing biology, right? Well, Craig Venter several years ago created an artificial cell, but all he did was, not all he did, it was a tremendous accomplishment, but all he did was take out the DNA from a cell and put in entirely new DNA and let it boot up and go. What about the leap to creating intelligent life on earth? Yeah. Again, we define intelligence, of course, but let's just even say Homo sapiens, the modern intelligence in our human brain. Do you have a sense of what's involved in that leap and how big of a leap that is? So AI would count in this, or do you really want life? Do you want really an organism in some sense? AI would count, I think. Okay. Yeah, of course, of course AI would count. Well, let's say artificial consciousness, right? So I do not think we are on the threshold of creating artificial consciousness. I think it's possible. I'm not, again, very educated about how close we are, but my impression is not that we're really close because we understand how little we understand of consciousness and what it is. So if we don't have any idea what it is, it's hard to imagine we're on the threshold of making it ourselves. But it's doable, it's possible. I don't see any obstacles in principle. So yeah, I would hold out some interest in that happening eventually. I think in general, consciousness, I think we would be just surprised how easy consciousness is once we create intelligence. I think consciousness is a thing that's just something we all fake. Well, good. No, actually, I like this idea that in fact, consciousness is way less mysterious than we think because we're all at every time, at every moment, less conscious than we think we are, right? We can fool things. And I think that plus the idea that you not only have artificial intelligent systems, but you put them in a body, right, give them a robot body, that will help the faking a lot. Yeah, I think creating consciousness in artificial consciousness is as simple as asking a Roomba to say, I'm conscious, and refusing to be talked out of it. Could be, it could be. And I mean, I'm almost being silly, but that's what we do. That's what we do with each other. This is the kind of, that consciousness is also a social construct. And a lot of our ideas of intelligence is a social construct. And so reaching that bar involves something that's beyond, that doesn't necessarily involve the fundamental understanding of how you go from electrons to neurons to cognition. No, actually, I think that is an extremely good point. And in fact, what it suggests is, so yeah, you referred to Kate Darling, who I had on the podcast, and who does these experiments with very simple robots, but they look like animals, and they can look like they're experiencing pain, and we human beings react very negatively to these little robots looking like they're experiencing pain. And what you wanna say is, yeah, but they're just robots. It's not really pain, right? It's just some electrons going around. But then you realize, you and I are just electrons going around, and that's what pain is also. And so what I would have an easy time imagining is that there is a spectrum between these simple little robots that Kate works with and a human being, where there are things that sort of by some strict definition, Turing test level thing are not conscious, but nevertheless walk and talk like they're conscious. And it could be that the future is, I mean, Siri is close, right? And so it might be the future has a lot more agents like that. And in fact, rather than someday going, aha, we have consciousness, we'll just creep up on it with more and more accurate reflections of what we expect. And in the future, maybe the present, for example, we haven't met before, and you're basically assuming that I'm human as it's a high probability at this time because the yeah, but in the future, there might be question marks around that, right? Yeah, no, absolutely. Certainly videos are almost to the point where you shouldn't trust them already. Photos you can't trust, right? Videos is easier to trust, but we're getting worse that, we're getting better at faking them, right? Yeah, so physical embodied people, what's so hard about faking that? So this is very depressing, this conversation we're having right now. So I mean, To me, it's exciting. To me, you're doing it. So it's exciting to you, but it's a sobering thought. We're very bad, right? At imagining what the next 50 years are gonna be like when we're in the middle of a phase transition as we are right now. Yeah, and I, in general, I'm not blind to all the threats. I am excited by the power of technology to solve, to protect us against the threats as they evolve. I'm not as much as Steven Pinker optimistic about the world, but in everything I've seen, all of the brilliant people in the world that I've met are good people. So the army of the good in terms of the development of technology is large. Okay, you're way more optimistic than I am. I think that goodness and badness are equally distributed among intelligent and unintelligent people. I don't see much of a correlation there. Interesting. Neither of us have proof. Yeah, exactly. Again, opinions are free, right? Nor definitions of good and evil. We come without definitions or without data opinions. So what kind of questions can science not currently answer and may never be able to answer in your view? Well, the obvious one is what is good and bad? What is right and wrong? I think that there are questions that, science tells us what happens, what the world is and what it does. It doesn't say what the world should do or what we should do, because we're part of the world. But we are part of the world and we have the ability to feel like something's right, something's wrong. And to make a very long story very short, I think that the idea of moral philosophy is systematizing our intuitions of what is right and what is wrong. And science might be able to predict ahead of time what we will do, but it won't ever be able to judge whether we should have done it or not. So, you're kind of unique in terms of scientists. Listen, it doesn't have to do with podcasts, but even just reaching out, I think you referred to as sort of doing interdisciplinary science. So you reach out and talk to people that are outside of your discipline, which I always hope that's what science was for. In fact, I was a little disillusioned when I realized that academia is very siloed. Yeah. And so the question is, how, at your own level, how do you prepare for these conversations? How do you think about these conversations? How do you open your mind enough to have these conversations? And it may be a little bit broader, how can you advise other scientists to have these kinds of conversations? Not at the podcast, the fact that you're doing a podcast is awesome, other people get to hear them, but it's also good to have it without mics in general. It's a good question, but a tough one to answer. I think about a guy I know who's a personal trainer, and he was asked on a podcast, how do we psych ourselves up to do a workout? How do we make that discipline to go and work out? And he's like, why are you asking me? I can't stop working out. I don't need to psych myself up. So, and likewise, he asked me, how do you get to have interdisciplinary conversations on all sorts of different things, all sorts of different people? I'm like, that's what makes me go, right? Like that's, I couldn't stop doing that. I did that long before any of them were recorded. In fact, a lot of the motivation for starting recording it was making sure I would read all these books that I had purchased, right? Like all these books I wanted to read, not enough time to read them. And now if I have the motivation, cause I'm gonna interview Pat Churchland, I'm gonna finally read her book. You know, and it's absolutely true that academia is extraordinarily siloed, right? We don't talk to people. We rarely do. And in fact, when we do, it's punished. You know, like the people who do it successfully generally first became very successful within their little siloed discipline. And only then did they start expanding out. If you're a young person, you know, I have graduate students. I try to be very, very candid with them about this, that it's, you know, most graduate students are to not become faculty members, right? It's a tough road. And so live the life you wanna live, but do it with your eyes open about what it does to your job chances. And the more broad you are and the less time you spend hyper specializing in your field, the lower your job chances are. That's just an academic reality. It's terrible, I don't like it, but it's a reality. And for some people, that's fine. Like there's plenty of people who are wonderful scientists who have zero interest in branching out and talking to things, to anyone outside their field. But it is disillusioning to me. Some of the, you know, romantic notion I had of the intellectual academic life is belied by the reality of it. The idea that we should reach out beyond our discipline and that is a positive good is just so rare in universities that it may as well not exist at all. But that said, even though you're saying you're doing it like the personal trainer, because you just can't help it, you're also an inspiration to others. Like I could speak for myself. You know, I also have a career I'm thinking about, right? And without your podcast, I may have not have been doing this at all, right? So it makes me realize that these kinds of conversations is kind of what science is about in many ways. The reason we write papers, this exchange of ideas, is it's much harder to do interdisciplinary papers, I would say. And conversations are easier. So conversations is the beginning. And in the field of AI, it's obvious that we should think outside of pure computer vision competitions on a particular data sets. We should think about the broader impact of how this can be, you know, reaching out to physics, to psychology, to neuroscience and having these conversations so that you're an inspiration. And so never know how the world changes. I mean, the fact that this stuff is out there and I've a huge number of people come up to me, grad students, really loving the podcast, inspired by it. And they will probably have that, they'll be ripple effects when they become faculty and so on and so on. We can end on a balance between pessimism and optimism. And Sean, thank you so much for talking to me, it was awesome. No, Lex, thank you very much for this conversation.

Jordan, a professor at Berkeley and one of the most influential people in the history of machine learning, statistics, and artificial intelligence. He has been cited over 170,000 times and he has mentored many of the world class researchers defining the field of AI today, including Andrew Ng, Zubin Garamani, Ben Taskar, and Yoshua Bengio. All this, to me, is as impressive as the over 32,000 points in the six NBA championships of the Michael J. Jordan of basketball fame. There's a nonzero probability that I talked to the other Michael Jordan given my connection to and love of the Chicago Bulls of the 90s, but if I had to pick one, I'm going with the Michael Jordan of statistics and computer science, or as Yann LeCun calls him, the Miles Davis of machine learning. In his blog post titled Artificial Intelligence, the Revolution Hasn't Happened Yet, Michael argues for broadening the scope of the artificial intelligence field. In many ways, the underlying spirit of this podcast is the same, to see artificial intelligence as a deeply human endeavor, to not only engineer algorithms and robots, but to understand and empower human beings at all levels of abstraction, from the individual to our civilization as a whole. This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast. If you enjoy it, subscribe and YouTube, give it five stars at Apple Podcast, support it on Patreon, or simply connect with me on Twitter at Lex Friedman spelled F R I D M A N. As usual, I'll do one or two minutes of ads now and never any ads in the middle that can break the flow of the conversation. I hope that works for you and doesn't hurt the listening experience. This show is presented by Cash App, the number one finance app in the App Store. When you get it, use code LEX PODCAST. Cash App lets you send money to friends, buy Bitcoin, and invest in the stock market with as little as $1. Since Cash App does fractional share trading, let me mention that the order execution algorithm that worked behind the scenes to create the abstraction of the fractional orders is to me an algorithmic marvel. Great props for the Cash App engineers for solving a hard problem that in the end provides an easy interface that takes a step up to the next layer of abstraction over the stock market, making trading more accessible for new investors and diversification much easier. So once again, if you get Cash App from the App Store or Google Play and use the code LEX PODCAST, you'll get $10 and Cash App will also donate $10 to First, one of my favorite organizations that is helping to advance robotics and STEM education for young people around the world. And now, here's my conversation with Michael I. Jordan. Given that you're one of the greats in the field of AI, machine learning, computer science, and so on, you're trivially called the Michael Jordan of machine learning, although as you know, you were born first, so technically MJ is the Michael I. Jordan of basketball. But anyway, my favorite is Yann LeCun calling you the Miles Davis of machine learning because as he says, you reinvent yourself periodically and sometimes leave fans scratching their heads after you change direction. So can you put at first your historian hat on and give a history of computer science and AI as you saw it, as you experienced it, including the four generations of AI successes that I've seen you talk about? Sure. Yeah, first of all, I much prefer Yann's metaphor. Miles Davis was a real explorer in jazz and he had a coherent story. So I think I have one, but it's not just the one you lived, it's the one you think about later. What the historian does is they look back and they revisit. I think what's happening right now is not AI, that was an intellectual aspiration that's still alive today as an aspiration. But I think this is akin to the development of chemical engineering from chemistry or electrical engineering from electromagnetism. So if you go back to the 30s or 40s, there wasn't yet chemical engineering. There was chemistry, there was fluid flow, there was mechanics and so on. But people pretty clearly viewed interesting goals to try to build factories that make chemicals products and do it viably, safely, make good ones, do it at scale. So people started to try to do that, of course, and some factories worked, some didn't, some were not viable, some exploded, but in parallel, developed a whole field called chemical engineering. Electrical engineering is a field, it's no bones about it, it has theoretical aspects to it, it has practical aspects. It's not just engineering, quote unquote, it's the real thing, real concepts are needed. Same thing with electrical engineering. There was Maxwell's equations, which in some sense were everything you know about electromagnetism, but you needed to figure out how to build circuits, how to build modules, how to put them together, how to bring electricity from one point to another safely and so on and so forth. So a whole field that developed called electrical engineering. I think that's what's happening right now, is that we have a proto field, which is statistics, more of the theoretical side of it, algorithmic side of computer science, that was enough to start to build things, but what things? Systems that bring value to human beings and use human data and mix in human decisions. The engineering side of that is all ad hoc. That's what's emerging. In fact, if you wanna call machine learning a field, I think that's what it is, that it's a proto form of engineering based on statistical and computational ideas of previous generations. But do you think there's something deeper about AI in his dreams and aspirations as compared to chemical engineering and electrical engineering? Well the dreams and aspirations maybe, but those are 500 years from now. I think that that's like the Greeks sitting there and saying, it would be neat to get to the moon someday. I think we have no clue how the brain does computation. We're just a clueless. We're even worse than the Greeks on most anything interesting scientifically of our era. Can you linger on that just for a moment because you stand not completely unique, but a little bit unique in the clarity of that. Can you elaborate your intuition of why we're, like where we stand in our understanding of the human brain? And a lot of people say, you know, scientists say we're not very far in understanding human brain, but you're like, you're saying we're in the dark here. Well, I know I'm not unique. I don't even think in the clarity, but if you talk to real neuroscientists that really study real synapses or real neurons, they agree, they agree. It's a hundreds of year task and they're building it up slowly and surely. What the signal is there is not clear. We think we have all of our metaphors. We think it's electrical, maybe it's chemical, it's a whole soup, it's ions and proteins and it's a cell. And that's even around like a single synapse. If you look at a electron micrograph of a single synapse, it's a city of its own. And that's one little thing on a dendritic tree, which is extremely complicated electrochemical thing. And it's doing these spikes and voltages are flying around and then proteins are taking that and taking it down into the DNA and who knows what. So it is the problem of the next few centuries. It is fantastic. But we have our metaphors about it. Is it an economic device? Is it like the immune system or is it like a layered set of, you know, arithmetic computations? We have all these metaphors and they're fun. But that's not real science per se. There is neuroscience. That's not neuroscience. All right. That's like the Greek speculating about how to get to the moon, fun, right? And I think that I like to say this fairly strongly because I think a lot of young people think we're on the verge because a lot of people who don't talk about it clearly let it be understood that, yes, we kind of, this is a brain inspired, we're kind of close, you know, breakthroughs are on the horizon. And that's scrupulous people sometimes who need money for their labs. That's what I'm saying, scrupulous, but people will oversell, I need money for my lab, I'm studying computational neuroscience, I'm going to oversell it. And so there's been too much of that. So I'll step into the gray area between metaphor and engineering with, I'm not sure if you're familiar with brain computer interfaces. So a company like Elon Musk has Neuralink that's working on putting electrodes into the brain and trying to be able to read, both read and send electrical signals. Just as you said, even the basic mechanism of communication in the brain is not something we understand. But do you hope without understanding the fundamental principles of how the brain works, we'll be able to do something interesting at that gray area of metaphor? It's not my area. So I hope in the sense, like anybody else hopes for some interesting things to happen from research, I would expect more something like Alzheimer's will get figured out from modern neuroscience. There's a lot of human suffering based on brain disease and we throw things like lithium at the brain, it kind of works, no one has a clue why. That's not quite true, but mostly we don't know. And that's even just about the biochemistry of the brain and how it leads to mood swings and so on. How thought emerges from that, we were really, really completely dim. So that you might want to hook up electrodes and try to do some signal processing on that and try to find patterns, fine, by all means, go for it. It's just not scientific at this point. So it's like kind of sitting in a satellite and watching the emissions from a city and trying to infer things about the microeconomy, even though you don't have microeconomic concepts. It's really that kind of thing. And so yes, can you find some signals that do something interesting or useful? Can you control a cursor or mouse with your brain? Yeah, absolutely, and then I can imagine business models based on that and even medical applications of that. But from there to understanding algorithms that allow us to really tie in deeply from the brain to computer, I just, no, I don't agree with Elon Musk. I don't think that's even, that's not for our generations, not even for the century. So just in hopes of getting you to dream, you've mentioned Kolmogorov and Turing might pop up, do you think that there might be breakthroughs that will get you to sit back in five, 10 years and say, wow? Oh, I'm sure there will be, but I don't think that there'll be demos that impress me. I don't think that having a computer call a restaurant and pretend to be a human is a breakthrough. Right. And people, you know, some people present it as such. It's imitating human intelligence. It's even putting coughs in the thing to make a bit of a PR stunt. And so fine that the world runs on those things too. And I don't want to diminish all the hard work and engineering that goes behind things like that and the ultimate value to the human race. But that's not scientific understanding. And I know the people that work on these things, they are after scientific understanding. In the meantime, they've got to kind of, you know, the trains got to run and they got mouths to feed and they got things to do and there's nothing wrong with all that. I would call that though, just engineering. And I want to distinguish that between an engineering field, like electrical engineering and chemical engineering that originally emerged, that had real principles and you really know what you're doing and you had a little scientific understanding, maybe not even complete. So it became more predictable and it really gave value to human life because it was understood. And so we don't want to muddle too much these waters of, you know, what we're able to do versus what we really can't do in a way that's going to impress the next. So I don't need to be wowed, but I think that someone comes along in 20 years, a younger person who's absorbed all the technology and for them to be wowed, I think they have to be more deeply impressed. A young Kolmogorov would not be wowed by some of the stunts that you see right now coming from the big companies. The demos, but do you think the breakthroughs from Kolmogorov would be, and give this question a chance, do you think there'll be in the scientific fundamental principles arena or do you think it's possible to have fundamental breakthroughs in engineering? Meaning, you know, I would say some of the things that Elon Musk is working with SpaceX and then others sort of trying to revolutionize the fundamentals of engineering, of manufacturing, of saying, here's a problem we know how to do a demo of and actually taking it to scale. Yeah. So there's going to be all kinds of breakthroughs. I just don't like that terminology. I'm a scientist and I work on things day in and day out and things move along and eventually you say, wow, something happened, but I don't like that language very much. Also I don't like to prize theoretical breakthroughs over practical ones. I tend to be more of a theoretician and I think there's lots to do in that arena right now. And so I wouldn't point to the Kolmogorovs, I might point to the Edisons of the era and maybe Musk is a bit more like that. But you know, Musk, God bless him, also will say things about AI that he knows very little about and he leads people astray when he talks about things he doesn't know anything about. Trying to program a computer to understand natural language, to be involved in a dialogue we're having right now, that ain't going to happen in our lifetime. You could fake it, you can mimic, sort of take old sentences that humans use and retread them, but the deep understanding of language, no, it's not going to happen. And so from that, I hope you can perceive that the deeper, yet deeper kind of aspects and intelligence are not going to happen. Now will there be breakthroughs? No, I think that Google was a breakthrough, I think Amazon is a breakthrough, you know, I think Uber is a breakthrough, you know, that bring value to human beings at scale in new, brand new ways based on data flows and so on. A lot of these things are slightly broken because there's not kind of an engineering field that takes economic value in context of data and, you know, planetary scale and worries about all the externalities, the privacy, you know, we don't have that field so we don't think these things through very well. I see that as emerging and that will be, you know, looking back from 100 years, that will be a constituted breakthrough in this era, just like electrical engineering was a breakthrough in the early part of the last century and chemical engineering was a breakthrough. So the scale, the markets that you talk about and we'll get to will be seen as sort of breakthrough and we're in the very early days of really doing interesting stuff there and we'll get to that, but just taking a quick step back, can you give, kind of throw off the historian hat. I mean, you briefly said that the history of AI kind of mimics the history of chemical engineering, but... I keep saying machine learning. You keep wanting to say AI, just to let you know, I don't, you know, I resist that. I don't think this is about AI really was John McCarthy as almost a philosopher saying, wouldn't it be cool if we could put thought in a computer? If we could mimic the human capability to think or put intelligence in, in some sense into a computer. That's an interesting philosophical question and he wanted to make it more than philosophy. He wanted to actually write down a logical formula and algorithms that would do that. And that is a perfectly valid, reasonable thing to do. That's not what's happening in this era. So the reason I keep saying AI actually, and I'd love to hear what you think about it. Machine learning has a very particular set of methods and tools. Maybe your version of it is that mine doesn't, it's very, very open. It does optimization, it does sampling, it does... So systems that learn is what machine learning is. Systems that learn and make decisions. And make decisions. So it's not just pattern recognition and, you know, finding patterns, it's all about making decisions in real worlds and having close feedback loops. So something like symbolic AI, expert systems, reasoning systems, knowledge based representation, all of those kinds of things, search, does that neighbor fit into what you think of as machine learning? So I don't even like the word machine learning, I think that what the field you're talking about is all about making large collections of decisions under uncertainty by large collections of entities. Right? And there are principles for that, at that scale. You don't have to say the principles are for a single entity that's making decisions, single agent or single human. It really immediately goes to the network of decisions. Is a good word for that or no? No, there's no good words for any of this. That's kind of part of the problem. So we can continue the conversation to use AI for all that. I just want to kind of raise the flag here that this is not about, we don't know what intelligence is and real intelligence. We don't know much about abstraction and reasoning at the level of humans. We don't have a clue. We're not trying to build that because we don't have a clue. Eventually it may emerge. They'll make, I don't know if there'll be breakthroughs, but eventually we'll start to get glimmers of that. It's not what's happening right now. Okay. We're taking data. We're trying to make good decisions based on that. We're trying to scale. We're trying to economically viably, we're trying to build markets. We're trying to keep value at that scale and aspects of this will look intelligent. Computers were so dumb before, they will seem more intelligent. We will use that buzzword of intelligence so we can use it in that sense. So machine learning, you can scope it narrowly as just learning from data and pattern recognition. But when I talk about these topics, maybe data science is another word you could throw in the mix, it really is important that the decisions are as part of it. It's consequential decisions in the real world. Am I going to have a medical operation? Am I going to drive down the street? Things where there's scarcity, things that impact other human beings or other environments and so on. How do I do that based on data? How do I do that adaptively? How do I use computers to help those kinds of things go forward? Whatever you want to call that. So let's call it AI. Let's agree to call it AI, but let's not say that the goal of that is intelligence. The goal of that is really good working systems at planetary scale that we've never seen before. So reclaim the word AI from the Dartmouth conference from many decades ago of the dream of humans. I don't want to reclaim it. I want a new word. I think it was a bad choice. I mean, if you read one of my little things, the history was basically that McCarthy needed a new name because cybernetics already existed and he didn't like, no one really liked Norbert Wiener. Norbert Wiener was kind of an island to himself and he felt that he had encompassed all this and in some sense he did. You look at the language of cybernetics, it was everything we're talking about. It was control theory and signal processing and some notions of intelligence and closed feedback loops and data. It was all there. It's just not a word that lived on partly because of the maybe the personalities. But McCarthy needed a new word to say, I'm different from you. I'm not part of your show. I got my own. Invented this word and again, thinking forward about the movies that would be made about it, it was a great choice. But thinking forward about creating a sober academic and real world discipline, it was a terrible choice because it led to promises that are not true that we understand. We understand artificial perhaps, but we don't understand intelligence. It's a small tangent because you're one of the great personalities of machine learning, whatever the heck you call the field. Do you think science progresses by personalities or by the fundamental principles and theories and research that's outside of personalities? Both. And I wouldn't say there should be one kind of personality. I have mine and I have my preferences and I have a kind of network around me that feeds me and some of them agree with me and some of them disagree, but all kinds of personalities are needed. Right now, I think the personality that it's a little too exuberant, a little bit too ready to promise the moon is a little bit too much in ascendance. And I do think that there's some good to that. It certainly attracts lots of young people to our field, but a lot of those people come in with strong misconceptions and they have to then unlearn those and then find something to do. And so I think there's just got to be some multiple voices and I wasn't hearing enough of the more sober voice. So as a continuation of a fun tangent and speaking of vibrant personalities, what would Yeah. And you think technically speaking, it's possible to help. I don't know the answers, but it's a, it's a, it's a less anonymity, a little more locality, you know, worlds that you kind of enter in and you trust the people there in those worlds so that when you start having a discussion, you know, not only is that people are not going to hurt you, but it's not going to be a total waste of your time because there's a lot of wasting of time that, you know, a lot of us, I pulled out of Facebook early on cause it was clearly going to waste a lot of my time even though there was some value. And so, yeah, worlds that are somehow you enter in and you know what you're getting and it's kind of appeals to you and you might, new things might happen, but you kind of have some, some trust in that world. And there's some deep, interesting, complex psychological aspects around anonymity, how that changes human behavior that's quite dark. Quite dark. Yeah. I think a lot of us are, especially those of us who really loved the advent of technology. I love social networks when they came out. I was just, I didn't see any negatives there at all. But then I started seeing comment sections. I think it was maybe, you know, with the CNN or something. And I started to go, wow, this, this darkness I just did not know about and, and our technology is now amplifying it. So sorry for the big philosophical question, but on that topic, do you think human beings, cause you've also, out of all things, had a foot in psychology too, the, do you think human beings are fundamentally good? Like all of us have good intent that could be mind or is it depending on context and environment, everybody could be evil. So my answer is fundamentally good. But fundamentally limited. All of us have very, you know, blinkers on. We don't see the other person's pain that easily. We don't see the other person's point of view that easily. We're very much in our own head, in our own world. And on my good days, I think the technology could open us up to, you know, more perspectives and more less blinkered and more understanding, you know, a lot of wars in human history happened because of just ignorance. They didn't, they, they thought the other person was doing this while their person wasn't doing this. And we have a huge amounts of that. But in my lifetime, I've not seen technology really help in that way yet. And I do, I do, I do believe in that, but you know, no, I think fundamentally humans are good. The people suffer, people have grievances because you have grudges and those things cause them to do things they probably wouldn't want. They regret it often. So no, I, I think it's a, you know, part of the progress of technology is to indeed allow it to be a little easier to be the real good person you actually are. Well, but do you think individual human life or society could be modeled as an optimization problem? Not the way I think typically, I mean, that's, you're talking about one of the most complex phenomenon in the whole, you know, in all of which the individual human life or society as a whole. Both, both. I mean, individual human life is amazingly complex. And so you know, optimization is kind of just one branch of mathematics that talks about certain kinds of things. And it just feels way too limited for the complexity of such things. What properties of optimization problems do you think, so do you think most interesting problems that could be solved through optimization, what kind of properties does that surface have non convexity, convexity, linearity, all those kinds of things, saddle points? Well, so optimization is just one piece of mathematics. You know, there's like, you just, even in our era, we're aware that say sampling is coming up, examples of something coming up with a distribution. What's optimization? What's sampling? Well, they, you can, if you're a kind of a certain kind of mathematician, you can try to blend them and make them seem to be sort of the same thing. But optimization is roughly speaking, trying to find a point that, a single point that is the optimum of a criterion function of some kind. And sampling is trying to, from that same surface, treat that as a distribution or density and find points that have high density. So I want the entire distribution in a sampling paradigm and I want the, you know, the single point, that's the best point in the optimization paradigm. Now if you were optimizing in the space of probability measures, the output of that could be a whole probability distribution. So you can start to make these things the same. But in mathematics, if you go too high up that kind of abstraction hierarchy, you start to lose the, you know, the ability to do the interesting theorems. So you kind of don't try that. You don't try to overly over abstract. So as a small tangent, what kind of worldview do you find more appealing? One that is deterministic or stochastic? Well, that's easy. I mean, I'm a statistician. You know, the world is highly stochastic. I don't know what's going to happen in the next five minutes, right? Because what you're going to ask, what we're going to do, what I'll say. Due to the uncertainty. Due to the... Massive uncertainty. Yeah. You know, massive uncertainty. And so the best I can do is have come rough sense or probability distribution on things and somehow use that in my reasoning about what to do now. So how does the distributed at scale when you have multi agent systems look like? So optimization can optimize sort of, it makes a lot more sense, sort of at least from my from robotics perspective, for a single robot, for a single agent, trying to optimize some objective function. When you start to enter the real world, this game theoretic concept starts popping up. That's how do you see optimization in this? Because you've talked about markets in a scale. What does that look like? Do you see it as optimization? Do you see it as sampling? Do you see like, how should you mark? These all blend together. And a system designer thinking about how to build an incentivized system will have a blend of all these things. So, you know, a particle in a potential well is optimizing a functional called a Lagrangian, right? The particle doesn't know that. There's no algorithm running that does that. It just happens. And so it's a description mathematically of something that helps us understand as analysts what's happening, right? And so the same thing will happen when we talk about, you know, mixtures of humans and computers and markets and so on and so forth, there'll be certain principles that allow us to understand what's happening, whether or not the actual algorithms are being used by any sense is not clear. Now at some point, I may have set up a multi agent or market kind of system. And I'm now thinking about an individual agent in that system. And they're asked to do some task and they're incentivized in some way, they get certain signals and they have some utility. What they will do at that point is they just won't know the answer, they may have to optimize to find an answer. Okay, so an artist could be embedded inside of an overall market. You know, and game theory is very, very broad. It is often studied very narrowly for certain kinds of problems. But it's roughly speaking, this is just the, I don't know what you're going to do. So I kind of anticipate that a little bit, and you anticipate what I'm anticipating. And we kind of go back and forth in our own minds. We run kind of thought experiments. You've talked about this interesting point in terms of game theory, you know, most optimization problems really hate saddle points, maybe you can describe what saddle points are. But I've heard you kind of mentioned that there's a there's a branch of optimization that you could try to explicitly look for saddle points as a good thing. Oh, not optimization. That's just game theory that that so there's all kinds of different equilibria in game theory. And some of them are highly explanatory behavior. They're not attempting to be algorithmic. They're just trying to say, if you happen to be at this equilibrium, you would see certain kind of behavior. And we see that in real life. That's what an economist wants to do, especially behavioral economists in continuous differential game theory, you're in continuous spaces, a some of the simplest equilibria are saddle points and Nash equilibrium as a saddle point. It's a special kind of saddle point. So classically, in game theory, you were trying to find Nash equilibria and an algorithmic game theory, you're trying to find algorithms that would find them. And so you're trying to find saddle points. I mean, so that's literally what you're trying to do. But you know, any economist knows that Nash equilibria have their limitations. They are definitely not that explanatory in many situations. They're not what you really want. There's other kind of equilibria. And there's names associated with these because they came from history with certain people working on them, but there will be new ones emerging. So you know, one example is a Stackelberg equilibrium. So you know, Nash, you and I are both playing this game against each other or for each other, maybe it's cooperative, and we're both going to think it through and then we're going to decide and we're going to do our thing simultaneously. You know, in a Stackelberg, no, I'm going to be the first mover. I'm going to make a move. You're going to look at my move and then you're going to make yours. Now since I know you're going to look at my move, I anticipate what you're going to do. And so I don't do something stupid, but then I know that you are also anticipating me. So we're kind of going back and forth on why, but there is then a first mover thing. And so those are different equilibria, right? And so just mathematically, yeah, these things have certain topologies and certain shapes that are like, what's it, algorithmically or dynamically, how do you move towards them? How do you move away from things? You know, so some of these questions have answers, they've been studied, others do not. And especially if it becomes stochastic, especially if there's large numbers of decentralized things, there's just, you know, young people get in this field who kind of think it's all done because we have, you know, TensorFlow. Well, no, these are all open problems and they're really important and interesting. And it's about strategic settings. How do I collect data? Suppose I don't know what you're going to do because I don't know you very well, right? Well, I got to collect data about you. So maybe I want to push you into a part of the space where I don't know much about you so I can get data. Cause, and then later I'll realize that you'll never, you'll never go there because of the way the game is set up. You know, that's part of the overall, you know, data analysis context is that. Even the game of poker is fascinating space, whenever there's any uncertainty, a lack of information, it's a super exciting space. Just to linger on optimization for a second. So when we look at deep learning, it's essentially minimization of a complicated loss function. So is there something insightful or hopeful that you see in the kinds of function surface that loss functions, the deep learning and in the real world is trying to optimize over? Is there something interesting as it's just the usual kind of problems of optimization? I think from an optimization point of view, that surface, first of all, it's pretty smooth. And secondly, if there's over, if it's over parameterized, there's kind of lots of paths down to reasonable Optima. And so kind of the getting downhill to the, to an optimum is viewed as not as hard as you might've expected in high dimensions. The fact that some Optima tend to be really good ones and others not so good. And you tend to, it's not, sometimes you find the good ones is sort of still needs explanation. Yeah. But, but the particular surface is coming from the particular generation of neural nets. I kind of suspect those will, those will change in 10 years. It will not be exactly those surfaces. There'll be some others that are an optimization theory will help contribute to why other surfaces or why other algorithms. Years of arithmetic operations with a little bit of nonlinearity, that's not, that didn't come from neuroscience per se. I mean, maybe in the minds of some of the people working on it, they were thinking about brains, but they were arithmetic circuits in all kinds of fields, computer science control theory and so on. And that layers of these could transform things in certain ways. And that if it's smooth, maybe you could find parameter values is a sort of big discovery that it's working, it's able to work at this scale. But I don't think that we're stuck with that and we're, we're certainly not stuck with that cause we're understanding the brain. So in terms of on the algorithm side sort of gradient descent, do you think we're stuck with gradient descent as a variance of it? What variance do you find interesting or do you think there'll be something else invented that is able to walk all over these optimization spaces in more interesting ways? So there's a co design of the surface and the, or the architecture and the algorithm. So if you just ask if we stay with the kind of architectures that we have now and not just neural nets, but you know, phase retrieval architectures or matrix completion architectures and so on. You know, I think we've kind of come to a place where yeah, a stochastic gradient algorithms are dominant and there are versions that are a little better than others. They have more guarantees, they're more robust and so on. And there's ongoing research to kind of figure out which is the best arm for which situation. But I think that that'll start to co evolve, that that'll put pressure on the actual architecture. And so we shouldn't do it in this particular way, we should do it in a different way because this other algorithm is now available if you do it in a different way. So that I can't really anticipate that co evolution process, but you know, gradients are amazing mathematical objects. They have a lot of people who start to study them more deeply mathematically are kind of shocked about what they are and what they can do. Think about it this way, suppose that I tell you if you move along the x axis, you go uphill in some objective by three units, whereas if you move along the y axis, you go uphill by seven units, right? Now I'm going to only allow you to move a certain unit distance, right? What are you going to do? Well, most people will say that I'm going to go along the y axis, I'm getting the biggest bang for my buck, you know, and my buck is only one unit, so I'm going to put all of it in the y axis, right? And why should I even take any of my strength, my step size and put any of it in the x axis because I'm getting less bang for my buck. That seems like a completely clear argument and it's wrong because the gradient direction is not to go along the y axis, it's to take a little bit of the x axis. And to understand that, you have to know some math and so even a trivial so called operator like gradient is not trivial and so, you know, exploiting its properties is still very important. Now we know that just pervading descent has got all kinds of problems, it gets stuck in many ways and it had never, you know, good dimension dependence and so on. So my own line of work recently has been about what kinds of stochasticity, how can we get dimension dependence, how can we do the theory of that and we've come up pretty favorable results with certain kinds of stochasticity. We have sufficient conditions generally. We know if you do this, we will give you a good guarantee. We don't have necessary conditions that it must be done a certain way in general. So stochasticity, how much randomness to inject into the walking along the gradient? And what kind of randomness? Why is randomness good in this process? Why is stochasticity good? Yeah, so I can give you simple answers but in some sense again, it's kind of amazing. Stochasticity just, you know, particular features of a surface that could have hurt you if you were doing one thing deterministically won't hurt you because by chance, there's very little chance that you would get hurt. So here stochasticity, it just kind of saves you from some of the particular features of surfaces. In fact, if you think about surfaces that are discontinuous in our first derivative, like an absolute value function, you will go down and hit that point where there's nondifferentiability. And if you're running a deterministic algorithm at that point, you can really do something bad. Whereas stochasticity just means it's pretty unlikely that's going to happen, that you're going to hit that point. So it's again, nontrivial to analyze but especially in higher dimensions, also stochasticity, our intuition isn't very good about it but it has properties that kind of are very appealing in high dimensions for a lot of large number of reasons. So it's all part of the mathematics to kind of, that's what's fun to work in the field is that you get to try to understand this mathematics. But long story short, you know, partly empirically, it was discovered stochastic gradient is very effective and theory kind of followed, I'd say, that but I don't see that we're getting clearly out of that. What's the most beautiful, mysterious, a profound idea to you in optimization? I don't know the most. But let me just say that Nesterov's work on Nesterov acceleration to me is pretty surprising and pretty deep. Can you elaborate? Well Nesterov acceleration is just that, suppose that we are going to use gradients to move around in a space. For the reasons I've alluded to, they're nice directions to move. And suppose that I tell you that you're only allowed to use gradients, you're not going to be allowed to use this local person that can only sense kind of the change in the surface. But I'm going to give you kind of a computer that's able to store all your previous gradients. And so you start to learn some something about the surface. And I'm going to restrict you to maybe move in the direction of like a linear span of all the gradients. So you can't kind of just move in some arbitrary direction, right? So now we have a well defined mathematical complexity model. There's certain classes of algorithms that can do that and others that can't. And we can ask for certain kinds of surfaces, how fast can you get down to the optimum? So there's answers to these. So for a smooth convex function, there's an answer, which is one over the number of steps squared. You will be within a ball of that size after k steps. Gradient descent in particular has a slower rate, it's one over k. So you could ask, is gradient descent actually, even though we know it's a good algorithm, is it the best algorithm? And the answer is no. Well, not clear yet, because one over k squared is a lower bound. That's probably the best you can do. Gradient is one over k, but is there something better? And so I think as a surprise to most, Nesterov discovered a new algorithm that has got two pieces to it. It's two gradients and puts those together in a certain kind of obscure way. And the thing doesn't even move downhill all the time. It sometimes goes back uphill. And if you're a physicist, that kind of makes some sense. You're building up some momentum and that is kind of the right intuition, but that intuition is not enough to understand kind of how to do it and why it works. But it does. It achieves one over k squared and it has a mathematical structure and it's still kind of to this day, a lot of us are writing papers and trying to explore that and understand it. So there are lots of cool ideas and optimization, but just kind of using gradients, I think is number one that goes back, you know, 150 years. And then Nesterov, I think has made a major contribution with this idea. So like you said, gradients themselves are in some sense, mysterious. They're not as trivial as... Not as trivial. Coordinate descent is more of a trivial one. You just pick one of the coordinates. That's how we think. That's how our human mind thinks. That's how our human minds think. And gradients are not that easy for our human mind to grapple with. An absurd question, but what is statistics? So here it's a little bit, it's somewhere between math and science and technology. It's somewhere in that convex hole. So it's a set of principles that allow you to make inferences that have got some reason to be believed and also principles that allow you to make decisions where you can have some reason to believe you're not going to make errors. So all of that requires some assumptions about what do you mean by an error? What do you mean by the probabilities? But after you start making some of those assumptions, you're led to conclusions that, yes, I can guarantee that if you do this in this way, your probability of making an error will be small. Your probability of continuing to not make errors over time will be small. And the probability that you found something that's real will be small, will be high. So decision making is a big part of that. Decision making is a big part. Yeah. So statistics, short history was that, it goes back as a formal discipline, 250 years or so. It was called inverse probability because around that era, probability was developed sort of especially to explain gambling situations. Of course, interesting. So you would say, well, given the state of nature is this, there's a certain roulette board that has a certain mechanism and what kind of outcomes do I expect to see? And especially if I do things long amounts of time, what outcomes will I see? And the physicists started to pay attention to this. And then people said, well, let's turn the problem around. What if I saw certain outcomes, could I infer what the underlying mechanism was? That's an inverse problem. And in fact, for quite a while, statistics was called inverse probability. That was the name of the field. And I believe that it was Laplace who was working in Napoleon's government who needed to do a census of France, learn about the people there. So he went and gathered data and he analyzed that data to determine policy and said, well, let's call this field that does this kind of thing statistics because the word state is in there. In French, that's etat, but it's the study of data for the state. So anyway, that caught on and it's been called statistics ever since. But by the time it got formalized, it was sort of in the 30s. And around that time, there was game theory and decision theory developed nearby. People in that era didn't think of themselves as either computer science or statistics or control or econ. They were all the above. And so Von Neumann is developing game theory, but also thinking of that as decision theory. Wald is an econometrician developing decision theory and then turning that into statistics. And so it's all about, here's not just data and you analyze it, here's a loss function. Here's what you care about. Here's the question you're trying to ask. Here is a probability model and here's the risk you will face if you make certain decisions. And to this day, in most advanced statistical curricula, you teach decision theory as the starting point and then it branches out into the two branches of Bayesian and frequentist. But that's all about decisions. In statistics, what is the most beautiful, mysterious, maybe surprising idea that you've come across? Yeah, good question. I mean, there's a bunch of surprising ones. There's something that's way too technical for this thing, but something called James Stein estimation, which is kind of surprising and really takes time to wrap your head around. Can you try to maybe... I think I don't want to even want to try. Let me just say a colleague at Steven Stigler at University of Chicago wrote a really beautiful paper on James Stein estimation, which helps to... It's views a paradox. It kind of defeats the mind's attempts to understand it, but you can and Steve has a nice perspective on that. So one of the troubles with statistics is that it's like in physics that are in quantum physics, you have multiple interpretations. There's a wave and particle duality in physics and you get used to that over time, but it still kind of haunts you that you don't really quite understand the relationship. The electron's a wave and electron's a particle. Well the same thing happens here. There's Bayesian ways of thinking and frequentist, and they are different. They sometimes become sort of the same in practice, but they are physically different. And then in some practice, they are not the same at all. They give you rather different answers. And so it is very much like wave and particle duality, and that is something that you have to kind of get used to in the field. Can you define Bayesian and frequentist? Yeah in decision theory you can make, I have a video that people could see. It's called are you a Bayesian or a frequentist and kind of help try to make it really clear. It comes from decision theory. So you know, decision theory, you're talking about loss functions, which are a function of data X and parameter theta. They're a function of two arguments. Okay. Neither one of those arguments is known. You don't know the data a priori. It's random and the parameters unknown. All right. So you have a function of two things you don't know, and you're trying to say, I want that function to be small. I want small loss, right? Well what are you going to do? So you sort of say, well, I'm going to average over these quantities or maximize over them or something so that, you know, I turn that uncertainty into something certain. So you could look at the first argument and average over it, or you could look at the second argument and average over it. That's Bayesian and frequentist. So the frequentist says, I'm going to look at the X, the data, and I'm going to take that as random and I'm going to average over the distribution. So I take the expectation loss under X. Theta is held fixed, right? That's called the risk. And so it's looking at other, all the data sets you could get, right? And say, how well will a certain procedure do under all those data sets? That's called a frequentist guarantee, right? So I think it is very appropriate when like you're building a piece of software and you're shipping it out there and people are using it on all kinds of data sets. You want to have a stamp, a guarantee on it that as people run it on many, many data sets that you never even thought about that 95% of the time it will do the right thing. Perfectly reasonable. The Bayesian perspective says, well, no, I'm going to look at the other argument of the loss function, the theta part, okay? That's unknown and I'm uncertain about it. So I could have my own personal probability for what it is, you know, how many tall people are there out there? I'm trying to infer the average height of the population while I have an idea roughly what the height is. So I'm going to average over the theta. So now that loss function as only now, again, one argument's gone, now it's a function of X and that's what a Bayesian does is they say, well, let's just focus on the particular X we got, the data set we got, we condition on that. Conditional on the X, I say something about my loss. That's a Bayesian approach to things. And the Bayesian will argue that it's not relevant to look at all the other data sets you could have gotten and average over them, the frequentist approach. It's really only the data sets you got, right? And I do agree with that, especially in situations where you're working with a scientist, you can learn a lot about the domain and you're really only focused on certain kinds of data and you gathered your data and you make inferences. I don't agree with it though, that, you know, in the sense that there are needs for frequentist guarantees, you're writing software, people are using it out there, you want to say something. So these two things have to got to fight each other a little bit, but they have to blend. So long story short, there's a set of ideas that are right in the middle that are called empirical Bayes. And empirical Bayes sort of starts with the Bayesian framework. It's kind of arguably philosophically more, you know, reasonable and kosher. Write down a bunch of the math that kind of flows from that, and then realize there's a bunch of things you don't know because it's the real world and you don't know everything. So you're uncertain about certain quantities. At that point, ask, is there a reasonable way to plug in an estimate for those things? Okay. And in some cases, there's quite a reasonable thing to do, to plug in, there's a natural thing you can observe in the world that you can plug in and then do a little bit more mathematics and assure yourself it's really good. So based on math or based on human expertise, what's, what, what are good? Oh, they're both going in. The Bayesian framework allows you to put a lot of human expertise in, but the math kind of guides you along that path and then kind of reassures you the end, you could put that stamp of approval under certain assumptions, this thing will work. So you asked the question, what's my favorite, you know, or what's the most surprising, nice idea. So one that is more accessible is something called false discovery rate, which is, you know, you're making not just one hypothesis test or making one decision, you're making a whole bag of them. And in that bag of decisions, you look at the ones where you made a discovery, you announced that something interesting had happened. All right. That's going to be some subset of your big bag. In the ones you made a discovery, which subset of those are bad? Or false, false discoveries. You'd like the fraction of your false discoveries among your discoveries to be small. That's a different criterion than accuracy or precision or recall or sensitivity and specificity. It's a different quantity. Those latter ones are almost all of them have more of a frequentist flavor. They say, given the truth is that the null hypothesis is true. Here's what accuracy I would get, or given that the alternative is true, here's what I would get. So it's kind of going forward from the state of nature to the data. The Bayesian goes the other direction from the data back to the state of nature. And that's actually what false discovery rate is. It says, given you made a discovery, okay, that's conditioned on your data. What's the probability of the hypothesis? It's going the other direction. And so the classical frequency look at that, well, I can't know that there's some priors needed in that. And the empirical Bayesian goes ahead and plows forward and starts writing down these formulas and realizes at some point, some of those things can actually be estimated in a reasonable way. And so it's kind of, it's a beautiful set of ideas. So I, this kind of line of argument has come out. It's not certainly mine, but it sort of came out from Robbins around 1960. Brad Efron has written beautifully about this in various papers and books. And the FDR is, you know, Benjamin in Israel, John Story did this Bayesian interpretation and so on. And he used to absorb these things over the years and find it a very healthy way to think about statistics. Let me ask you about intelligence to jump slightly back out into philosophy, perhaps. You said that maybe you can elaborate, but you said that defining just even the question of what is intelligence is a very difficult question. Is it a useful question? Do you think we'll one day understand the fundamentals of human intelligence and what it means, you know, have good benchmarks for general intelligence that we put before our machines? So I don't work on these topics so much that you're really asking the question for a psychologist really. And I studied some, but I don't consider myself at least an expert at this point. You know, a psychologist aims to understand human intelligence, right? And I think many psychologists I know are fairly humble about this. They might try to understand how a baby understands, you know, whether something's a solid or liquid or whether something's hidden or not. And maybe how a child starts to learn the meaning of certain words, what's a verb, what's a noun and also, you know, slowly but surely trying to figure out things. But humans ability to take a really complicated environment, reason about it, abstract about it, find the right abstractions, communicate about it, interact and so on is just, you know, really staggeringly rich and complicated. And so, you know, I think in all humility, we don't think we're kind of aiming for that in the near future. A certain psychologist doing experiments with babies in the lab or with people talking has a much more limited aspiration. And you know, Kahneman and Tversky would look at our reasoning patterns and they're not deeply understanding all the how we do our reasoning, but they're sort of saying, hey, here's some oddities about the reasoning and some things you should think about it. But also, as I emphasize in some things I've been writing about, you know, AI, the revolution hasn't happened yet. Yeah. Great blog post. I've been emphasizing that, you know, if you step back and look at intelligent systems of any kind and whatever you mean by intelligence, it's not just the humans or the animals or, you know, the plants or whatever, you know, so a market that brings goods into a city, you know, food to restaurants or something every day is a system. It's a decentralized set of decisions. Looking at it from far enough away, it's just like a collection of neurons. Every neuron is making its own little decisions, presumably in some way. And if you step back enough, every little part of an economic system is making all of its decisions. And just like with the brain, who knows what an individual neuron does and what the overall goal is, right? But something happens at some aggregate level, same thing with the economy. People eat in a city and it's robust. It works at all scales, small villages to big cities. It's been working for thousands of years. It works rain or shine, so it's adaptive. So all the kind of, you know, those are adjectives one tends to apply to intelligent systems. Robust, adaptive, you know, you don't need to keep adjusting it, self healing, whatever. Plus not perfect. You know, intelligences are never perfect and markets are not perfect. But I do not believe in this era that you cannot, that you can say, well, our computers are, our humans are smart, but you know, no markets are not, more markets are. So they are intelligent. Now we humans didn't evolve to be markets. We've been participating in them, right? But we are not ourselves a market per se. The neurons could be viewed as the market. There's economic, you know, neuroscience kind of perspective. That's interesting to pursue all that. The point though is, is that if you were to study humans and really be the world's best psychologist studied for thousands of years and come up with the theory of human intelligence, you might have never discovered principles of markets, you know, supply demand curves and you know, matching and auctions and all that. Those are real principles and they lead to a form of intelligence that's not maybe human intelligence. It's arguably another kind of intelligence. There probably are third kinds of intelligence or fourth that none of us are really thinking too much about right now. So if you really, and then all of those are relevant to computer systems in the future. Certainly the market one is relevant right now. Whereas the understanding of human intelligence is not so clear that it's relevant right now. Probably not. So if you want general intelligence, whatever one means by that, or, you know, understanding intelligence in a deep sense and all that, it is definitely has to be not just human intelligence. It's gotta be this broader thing. And that's not a mystery. Markets are intelligent. So, you know, it's definitely not just a philosophical stance to say we've got to move beyond intelligence. That sounds ridiculous. Yeah. But it's not. And in that blog post, you define different kinds of like intelligent infrastructure, AI, which I really like is some of the concepts you've just been describing. Do you see ourselves, if we see earth, human civilization as a single organism, do you think the intelligence of that organism, when you think from the perspective of markets and intelligence infrastructure is increasing, is it increasing linearly? Is it increasing exponentially? What do you think the future of that intelligence? Yeah, I don't know. I don't tend to think, I don't tend to answer questions like that because you know, that's science fiction. I'm hoping to catch you off guard. Well again, because you said it's so far in the future, it's fun to ask and you'll probably, you know, like you said, predicting the future is really nearly impossible. But say as an axiom, one day we create a human level, a superhuman level intelligent, not the scale of markets, but the scale of an individual. What do you think it is, what do you think it would take to do that? Or maybe to ask another question is how would that system be different than the biological human beings that we see around us today? Is it possible to say anything interesting to that question or is it just a stupid question? It's not a stupid question, but it's science fiction. Science fiction. And so I'm totally happy to read science fiction and think about it from time in my own life. I loved, there was this like brain in a vat kind of, you know, little thing that people were talking about when I was a student, I remember, you know, imagine that, you know, between your brain and your body, there's a, you know, there's a bunch of wires, right? And suppose that every one of them was replaced with a literal wire. And then suppose that wire was turned in actually a little wireless, you know, there's a receiver and sender. So the brain has got all the senders and receiver, you know, on all of its exiting, you know, axons and all the dendrites down to the body have replaced with senders and receivers. Now you could move the body off somewhere and put the brain in a vat, right? And then you could do things like start killing off those senders and receivers one by one. And after you've killed off all of them, where is that person? You know, they thought they were out in the body walking around the world and they moved on. So those are science fiction things. Those are fun to think about. It's just intriguing about where is, what is thought, where is it and all that. And I think every 18 year old should take philosophy classes and think about these things. And I think that everyone should think about what could happen in society that's kind of bad and all that. But I really don't think that's the right thing for most of us that are my age group to be doing and thinking about. I really think that we have so many more present, you know, first challenges and dangers and real things to build and all that such that, you know, spending too much time on science fiction, at least in public for like this, I think is not what we should be doing. Maybe over beers in private. That's right. Well, I'm not going to broadcast where I have beers because this is going to go on Facebook and I don't want a lot of people showing up there. But yeah, I'll, I love Facebook, Twitter, Amazon, YouTube. I have I'm optimistic and hopeful, but maybe, maybe I don't have grounds for such optimism and hope. But let me ask, you've mentored some of the brightest sort of some of the seminal figures in the field. Can you give advice to people who are undergraduates today? What does it take to take, you know, advice on their journey if they're interested in machine learning and in the ideas of markets from economics and psychology and all the kinds of things that you've exploring? What steps should they take on that journey? Well, yeah, first of all, the door is open and second, it's a journey. I like your language there. It is not that you're so brilliant and you have great, brilliant ideas and therefore that's just, you know, that's how you have success or that's how you enter into the field. It's that you apprentice yourself, you spend a lot of time, you work on hard things, you try and pull back and you be as broad as you can, you talk to lots of people. And it's like entering in any kind of a creative community. There's years that are needed and human connections are critical to it. So, you know, I think about, you know, being a musician or being an artist or something, you don't just, you know, immediately from day one, you know, you're a genius and therefore you do it. No, you, you know, practice really, really hard on basics and you be humble about where you are and then, and you realize you'll never be an expert on everything. So you kind of pick and there's a lot of randomness and a lot of kind of luck, but luck just kind of picks out which branch of the tree you go down, but you'll go down some branch. So yeah, it's a community. So the graduate school is, I still think is one of the wonderful phenomena that we have in our, in our world. It's very much about apprenticeship with an advisor. It's very much about a group of people you belong to. It's a four or five year process. So it's plenty of time to start from kind of nothing to come up to something, you know, more, more expertise, and then to start to have your own creativity start to flower, even surprising your own self. And it's a very cooperative endeavor. I think a lot of people think of science as highly competitive and I think in some other fields it might be more so. Here it's way more cooperative than you might imagine. And people are always teaching each other something and people are always more than happy to be clear that, so I feel I'm an expert on certain kinds of things, but I'm very much not expert on lots of other things and a lot of them are relevant and a lot of them are, I should know, but should in some society, you know, you don't. So I'm always willing to reveal my ignorance to people around me so they can teach me things. And I think a lot of us feel that way about our field. So it's very cooperative. I might add it's also very international because it's so cooperative. We see no barriers. And so that the nationalism that you see, especially in the current era and everything is just at odds with the way that most of us think about what we're doing here, where this is a human endeavor and we cooperate and are very much trying to do it together for the, you know, the benefit of everybody. So last question, where and how and why did you learn French and which language is more beautiful English or French? Great question. So first of all, I think Italian is actually more beautiful than French and English. And I also speak that. So I'm married to an Italian and I have kids and we speak Italian. Anyway, all kidding aside, every language allows you to express things a bit differently. And it is one of the great fun things to do in life is to explore those things. So in fact, when I kids or teens or college students ask me what they study, I say, well, do what your heart, where your heart is, certainly do a lot of math. Math is good for everybody, but do some poetry and do some history and do some language too. You know, throughout your life, you'll want to be a thinking person. You'll want to have done that. For me, French I learned when I was, I'd say a late teen, I was living in the middle of the country in Kansas and not much was going on in Kansas with all due respect to Kansas. And so my parents happened to have some French books on the shelf and just in my boredom, I pulled them down and I found this is fun. And I kind of learned the language by reading. And when I first heard it spoken, I had no idea what was being spoken, but I realized I had somehow knew it from some previous life and so I made the connection. But then I traveled and just I love to go beyond my own barriers and my own comfort or whatever. And I found myself on trains in France next to say older people who had lived a whole life of their own. And the ability to communicate with them was special and the ability to also see myself in other people's shoes and have empathy and kind of work on that language as part of that. So after that kind of experience and also embedding myself in French culture, which is quite amazing, languages are rich, not just because there's something inherently beautiful about it, but it's all the creativity that went into it. So I learned a lot of songs, read poems, read books. And then I was here actually at MIT where we're doing the podcast today and a young professor not yet married and not having a lot of friends in the area. So I just didn't have, I was kind of a bored person. I said, I heard a lot of Italians around. There's happened to be a lot of Italians at MIT, an Italian professor for some reason. And so I was kind of vaguely understanding what they were talking about. I said, well, I should learn this language too. So I did. And then later met my spouse and Italian became a part of my life. But I go to China a lot these days. I go to Asia, I go to Europe and every time I go, I kind of am amazed by the richness of human experience and the people don't have any idea if you haven't traveled, kind of how amazingly rich and I love the diversity. It's not just a buzzword to me. It really means something. I love to embed myself with other people's experiences. And so yeah, learning language is a big part of that. I think I've said in some interview at some point that if I had millions of dollars and infinite time or whatever, what would you really work on if you really wanted to do AI? And for me, that is natural language and really done right. Deep understanding of language. That's to me, an amazingly interesting scientific challenge. One we're very far away on. One we're very far away, but good natural language. People are kind of really invested then. I think a lot of them see that's where the core of AI is that if you understand that you really help human communication, you understand something about the human mind, the semantics that come out of the human mind and I agree, I think that will be such a long time. So I didn't do that in my career just cause I kind of, I was behind in the early days. I didn't kind of know enough of that stuff. I was at MIT, I didn't learn much language and it was too late at some point to kind of spend a whole career doing that, but I admire that field and so in my little way by learning language, you know, kind of that part of my brain has been trained up. Jan was right. You truly are the Miles Davis of machine learning. I don't think there's a better place than it. Mike it was a huge honor talking to you today. Merci beaucoup. All right.

And now let me leave you with some words of wisdom from Michael I. Jordan from his blog post titled Artificial Intelligence, the revolution hasn't happened yet, calling for broadening the scope of the AI field. We should embrace the fact that what we are witnessing is the creation of a new branch of engineering. The term engineering is often invoked in a narrow sense in academia and beyond with overtones of cold, effectless machinery and negative connotations of loss of control by humans. But an engineering discipline can be what we want it to be. In the current era, we have a real opportunity to conceive of something historically new, a human centric engineering discipline. I will resist giving this emerging discipline a name, but if the acronym AI continues to be used, let's be aware of the very real limitations of this placeholder. Let's broaden our scope, tone down the hype, and recognize the serious challenges ahead. Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time. you say is the most interesting disagreement you have with Jan Lacune? So Jan's an old friend and I just say that I don't think we disagree about very much really. He and I both kind of have a let's build it kind of mentality and does it work kind of mentality and kind of concrete. We both speak French and we speak French more together and we have a lot in common. And so if one wanted to highlight a disagreement, it's not really a fundamental one. I think it's just kind of what we're emphasizing. Jan has emphasized pattern recognition and has emphasized prediction. And it's interesting to try to take that as far as you can. If you could do perfect prediction, what would that give you kind of as a thought experiment? And I think that's way too limited. We cannot do perfect prediction. We will never have the data sets that allow me to figure out what you're about ready to do, what question you're going to ask next. I have no clue. I will never know such things. Moreover, most of us find ourselves during the day in all kinds of situations we had no anticipation of that are kind of very, very novel in various ways. And in that moment, we want to think through what we want. And also there's going to be market forces acting on us. I'd like to go down that street, but now it's full because there's a crane in the street. I got it. I got to think about that. I got to think about what I might really want here. And I got to sort of think about how much it costs me to do this action versus this action. I got to think about the risks involved. A lot of our current pattern recognition and prediction systems don't do any risk evaluations. They have no error bars, right? I got to think about other people's decisions around me. I got to think about a collection of my decisions, even just thinking about like a medical treatment, you know, I'm not going to take a, the prediction of a neural net about my health, about something consequential. I'm not about ready to have a heart attack because some number is over 0.7. Even if you had all the data in the world that ever been collected about heart attacks better than any doctor ever had, I'm not going to trust the output of that neural net to predict my heart attack. I'm going to want to ask what if questions around that. I'm going to want to look at some us or other possible data I didn't have, causal things. I'm going to want to have a dialogue with a doctor about things we didn't think about when he gathered the data. You know, I could go on and on. I hope you can see. And I don't, I think that if you say predictions, everything that, that, that you're missing all of this stuff. And so prediction plus decision making is everything, but both of them are equally important. And so the field has emphasized prediction, Jan rightly so has seen how powerful that is. But at the cost of people not being aware that decision making is where the rubber really hits the road, where human lives are at stake, where risks are being taken, where you got to gather more data. You got to think about the error bars. You got to think about the consequences of your decisions on others. You got to think about the economy around your decisions, blah, blah, blah, blah. I'm not the only one working on those, but we're a smaller tribe. And right now we're not the one that people talk about the most. But you know, if you go out in the real world and industry, you know, at Amazon, I'd say half the people there are working on decision making and the other half are doing, you know, the pattern recognition. It's important. And the words of pattern recognition and prediction, I think the distinction there, not to linger on words, but the distinction there is more a constrained sort of in the lab data set versus decision making is talking about consequential decisions in the real world, under the messiness and the uncertainty of the real world. And just the whole of it, the whole mess of it that actually touches human beings and scale. And the forces, that's the distinction. It helps add those, that perspective, that broader perspective. You're right. I totally agree. On the other hand, if you're a real prediction person, of course, you want it to be in the real world. You want to predict real world events. I'm just saying that's not possible with just data sets. That it has to be in the context of, you know, strategic things that someone's doing, data they might gather, things they could have gathered, the reasoning process around data. It's not just taking data and making predictions based on the data. So one of the things that you're working on, I'm sure there's others working on it, but I don't hear often it talked about, especially in the clarity that you talk about it, and I think it's both the most exciting and the most concerning area of AI in terms of decision making. So you've talked about AI systems that help make decisions that scale in a distributed way, millions, billions decisions, sort of markets of decisions. Can you, as a starting point, sort of give an example of a system that you think about when you're thinking about these kinds of systems? Yeah, so first of all, you're absolutely getting into some territory, which I will be beyond my expertise. And there are lots of things that are going to be very not obvious to think about. Just like, again, I like to think about history a little bit, but think about put yourself back in the sixties. There was kind of a banking system that wasn't computerized really. There was database theory emerging and database people had to think about how do I actually not just move data around, but actual money and have it be, you know, valid and have transactions that ATMs happen that are actually, you know, all valid and so on and so forth. So that's the kind of issues you get into when you start to get serious about sorts of things like this. I like to think about as kind of almost a thought experiment to help me think something simpler, which is the music market. And because there is, to first order, there is no music market in the world right now and in our country, for sure. There are something called things called record companies and they make money and they prop up a few really good musicians and make them superstars and they all make huge amounts of money. But there's a long tail of huge numbers of people that make lots and lots of really good music that is actually listened to by more people than the famous people. They are not in a market. They cannot have a career. They do not make money. The creators, the creators, the creators, the so called influencers or whatever that diminishes who they are. So there are people who make extremely good music, especially in the hip hop or Latin world these days. They do it on their laptop. That's what they do on the weekend and they have another job during the week and they put it up on SoundCloud or other sites. Eventually it gets streamed. It now gets turned into bits. It's not economically valuable. The information is lost. It gets put up there. People stream it. You walk around in a big city, you see people with headphones, especially young kids listening to music all the time. If you look at the data, very little of the music they are listening to is the famous people's music and none of it's old music. It's all the latest stuff. But the people who made that latest stuff are like some 16 year old somewhere who will never make a career out of this, who will never make money. Of course there will be a few counter examples. The record companies incentivize to pick out a few and highlight them. Long story short, there's a missing market there. There is not a consumer producer relationship at the level of the actual creative acts. The pipelines and Spotify's of the world that take this stuff and stream it along, they make money off of subscriptions or advertising and those things. They're making the money. All right. And then they will offer bits and pieces of it to a few people again to highlight that they simulate a market. Anyway, a real market would be if you're a creator of music that you actually are somebody who's good enough that people want to listen to you, you should have the data available to you. There should be a dashboard showing a map of the United States. So in last week, here's all the places your songs were listened to. It should be transparent, vetable, so that if someone down in Providence sees that you're being listened to 10,000 times in Providence, that they know that's real data. You know it's real data. They will have you come give a show down there. They will broadcast to the people who've been listening to you that you're coming. If you do this right, you could go down there and make $20,000. You do that three times a year, you start to have a career. So in this sense, AI creates jobs. It's not about taking away human jobs. It's creating new jobs because it creates a new market. Once you've created a market, you've now connected up producers and consumers. The person who's making the music can say to someone who comes to their shows a lot, hey, I'll play at your daughter's wedding for $10,000. You'll say 8,000. They'll say 9,000. Then again, you can now get an income up to $100,000. You're not going to be a millionaire. And now even think about really the value of music is in these personal connections, even so much so that a young kid wants to wear a tshirt with their favorite musician's signature on it. So if they listen to the music on the internet, the internet should be able to provide them with a button that they push and the merchandise arrives the next day. We can do that. And now why should we do that? Well, because the kid who bought the shirt will be happy, but more the person who made the music will get the money. There's no advertising needed. So you can create markets between producers and consumers, take 5% cut. Your company will be perfectly sound. It'll go forward into the future and it will create new markets and that raises human happiness. Now this seems like, well, this is easy, just create this dashboard, kind of create some connections and all that. But if you think about Uber or whatever, you think about the challenges in the real world of doing things like this, and there are actually new principles going to be needed. You're trying to create a new kind of two way market at a different scale that's ever been done before. There's going to be unwanted aspects of the market. There'll be bad people. There'll be the data will get used in the wrong ways, it'll fail in some ways, it won't deliver about. You have to think that through. Just like anyone who ran a big auction or ran a big matching service in economics will think these things through. And so that maybe doesn't get at all the huge issues that can arise when you start to create markets, but it starts to, at least for me, solidify my thoughts and allow me to move forward in my own thinking. Yeah. So I talked to the head of research at Spotify actually, and I think their longterm goal, they've said, is to have at least one million creators make a comfortable living putting on Spotify. So I think you articulate a really nice vision of the world and the digital and the cyberspace of markets. What do you think companies like Spotify or YouTube or Netflix can do to create such markets? Is it an AI problem? Is it an interface problem for interface design? Is it some other kind of, is it an economics problem? Who should they hire to solve these problems? Well, part of it's not just top down. So the Silicon Valley has this attitude that they know how to do it. They will create the system just like Google did with the search box that will be so good that they'll just, everyone will adopt that. It's everything you said, but really I think missing that kind of culture. So it's literally that 16 year old who's able to create the songs. You don't create that as a Silicon Valley entity. You don't hire them per se. You have to create an ecosystem in which they are wanted and that they belong. And so you have to have some cultural credibility to do things like this. Netflix, to their credit, wanted some of that credibility and they created shows, content. They call it content. It's such a terrible word, but it's culture. And so with movies, you can kind of go give a large sum of money to somebody graduating from the USC film school. It's a whole thing of its own, but it's kind of like rich white people's thing to do. And American culture has not been so much about rich white people. It's been about all the immigrants, all the Africans who came and brought that culture and those rhythms to this world and created this whole new thing. American culture. And so companies can't artificially create that. They can't just say, hey, we're here. We're going to buy it up. You've got a partner. And so anyway, not to denigrate, these companies are all trying and they should, and I'm sure they're asking these questions and some of them are even making an effort. But it is partly a respect the culture as a technology person. You've got to blend your technology with cultural meaning. How much of a role do you think the algorithm, so machine learning has in connecting the consumer to the creator, sort of the recommender system aspect of this? Yeah. It's a great question. I think pretty high. There's no magic in the algorithms, but a good recommender system is way better than a bad recommender system. And recommender systems is a billion dollar industry back even 10, 20 years ago. And it continues to be extremely important going forward. What's your favorite recommender system, just so we can put something, well, just historically I was one of the, when I first went to Amazon, I first didn't like Amazon because they put the book people out of business or the library, the local booksellers went out of business. I've come to accept that there probably are more books being sold now and poor people reading them than ever before. And then local book stores are coming back. So that's how economics sometimes work. You go up and you go down. But anyway, when I finally started going there and I bought a few books, I was really pleased to see another few books being recommended to me that I never would have thought of. And I bought a bunch of them. So they obviously had a good business model. But I learned things and I still to this day kind of browse using that service. And I think lots of people get a lot, that is a good aspect of a recommendation system. I'm learning from my peers in an indirect way. And their algorithms are not meant to have them impose what we learn. It really is trying to find out what's in the data. It doesn't work so well for other kinds of entities, but that's just the complexity of human life. Like shirts, I'm not going to get recommendations on shirts, but that's interesting. If you try to recommend restaurants, it's hard. It's hard to do it at scale. But a blend of recommendation systems with other economic ideas, matchings and so on is really, really still very open research wise. And there's new companies that are going to emerge that do that well. What do you think is going to the messy, difficult land of say politics and things like that, that YouTube and Twitter have to deal with in terms of recommendation systems? Being able to suggest, I think Facebook just launched Facebook news. So recommend the kind of news that are most likely for you to be interesting. Do you think this is AI solvable, again, whatever term we want to use, do you think it's a solvable problem for machines or is it a deeply human problem that's unsolvable? So I don't even think about it at that level. I think that what's broken with some of these companies, it's all monetization by advertising. They're not, at least Facebook, I want to critique them, but they didn't really try to connect a producer and a consumer in an economic way, right? No one wants to pay for anything. And so they all, you know, starting with Google and Facebook, they went back to the playbook of, you know, the television companies back in the day. No one wanted to pay for this signal. They will pay for the TV box, but not for the signal, at least back in the day. And so advertising kind of filled that gap and advertising was new and interesting and it somehow didn't take over our lives quite, right? Fast forward, Google provides a service that people don't want to pay for. And so somewhat surprisingly in the nineties, they made, they ended up making huge amounts so they cornered the advertising market. It didn't seem like that was going to happen, at least to me. These little things on the right hand side of the screen just did not seem all that economically interesting, but that companies had maybe no other choice. The TV market was going away and billboards and so on. So they've, they got it. And I think that sadly that Google just has, it was doing so well with that at making such money. They didn't think much more about how, wait a minute, is there a producer consumer relationship to be set up here? Not just between us and the advertisers market to be created. Is there an actual market between the producer consumer? They're the producers, the person who created that video clip, the person that made that website, the person who could make more such things, the person who could adjust it as a function of demand, the person on the other side who's asking for different kinds of things, you know? So you see glimmers of that now there's influencers and there's kind of a little glimmering of a market, but it should have been done 20 years ago. It should have been thought about. It should have been created in parallel with the advertising ecosystem. And then Facebook inherited that. And I think they also didn't think very much about that. So fast forward and now they are making huge amounts of money off of advertising. And the news thing and all these clicks is just feeding the advertising. It's all connected up to the advertiser. So you want more people to click on certain things because that money flows to you, Facebook. You're very much incentivized to do that. And when you start to find it's breaking, people are telling you, well, we're getting into some troubles. You try to adjust it with your smart AI algorithms, right? And figure out what are bad clicks. So maybe it shouldn't be click through rate, it should be something else. I find that pretty much hopeless. It does get into all the complexity of human life and you can try to fix it. You should, but you could also fix the whole business model. And the business model is that really, what are, are there some human producers and consumers out there? Is there some economic value to be liberated by connecting them directly? Is it such that it's so valuable that people will be able to pay for it? All right. And micro payments, like small payments. Micro, but even have to be micro. So I like the example, suppose I'm going, next week I'm going to India. Never been to India before. Right? I have a couple of days in Mumbai, I have no idea what to do there. Right? And I could go on the web right now and search. It's going to be kind of hopeless. I'm not going to find, you know, I have lots of advertisers in my face. Right? What I really want to do is broadcast to the world that I am going to Mumbai and have someone on the other side of a market look at me and, and there's a recommendation system there. So I'm not looking at all possible people coming to Mumbai. They're looking at the people who are relevant to them. So someone in my age group, someone who kind of knows me in some level, I give up a little privacy by that, but I'm happy because what I'm going to get back is this person can make a little video for me, or they're going to write a little two page paper on here's the cool things that you want to do and move by this week, especially, right? I'm going to look at that. I'm not going to pay a micro payment. I'm going to pay, you know, a hundred dollars or whatever for that. It's real value. It's like journalism. Um, and as an honest subscription, it's that I'm going to pay that person in that moment. Company's going to take 5% of that. And that person has now got it. It's a gig economy, if you will, but you know, done for it, you know, thinking about a little bit behind YouTube, there was actually people who could make more of those things. If they were connected to a market, they would make more of those things independently. You don't have to tell them what to do. You don't have to incentivize them any other way. Um, and so, yeah, these companies, I don't think have thought long and hard about that. So I do distinguish on Facebook on the one side, who just not thought about these things at all. I think, uh, thinking that AI will fix everything, uh, and Amazon thinks about them all the time because they were already out in the real world. They were delivering packages, people's doors. They were, they were worried about a market. They were worried about sellers and, you know, they worry and some things they do are great. Some things maybe not so great, but you know, they're in that business model. And then I'd say Google sort of hovers somewhere in between. I don't, I don't think for a long, long time they got it. I think they probably see that YouTube is more pregnant with possibility than, than, than they might've thought and that they're probably heading that direction. Um, but uh, you know, Silicon Valley has been dominated by the Google Facebook kind of mentality and the subscription and advertising and that is, that's the core problem, right? The fake news actually rides on top of that because it means that you're monetizing with clip through rate and that is the core problem. You got to remove that. So advertisement, if we're going to linger on that, I mean, that's an interesting thesis. I don't know if everyone really deeply thinks about that. So you're right. The thought is the advertising model is the only thing we have, the only thing we'll ever have. We have to fix, we have to build algorithms that despite that business model, you know, find the better angels of our nature and do good by society and by the individual. But you think we can slowly, you think, first of all, there's a difference between should and could. So you're saying we should slowly move away from the advertising model and have a direct connection between the consumer and the creator. The question I also have is, can we, because the advertising model is so successful now in terms of just making a huge amount of money and therefore being able to build a big company that provides, has really smart people working that create a good service. Do you think it's possible? And just to clarify, you think we should move away? Well, I think we should. Yeah. But we is the, you know, me. So society. Yeah. Well, the companies, I mean, so first of all, full disclosure, I'm doing a day a week at Amazon because I kind of want to learn more about how they do things. So, you know, I'm not speaking for Amazon in any way, but, you know, I did go there because I actually believe they get a little bit of this or trying to create these markets. And they don't really use, advertising is not a crucial part of it. Well, that's a good question. So it has become not crucial, but it's become more and more present if you go to Amazon website. And, you know, without revealing too many deep secrets about Amazon, I can tell you that, you know, a lot of people in the company question this and there's a huge questioning going on. You do not want a world where there's zero advertising. That actually is a bad world. Okay. So here's a way to think about it. You're a company that like Amazon is trying to bring products to customers, right? And the customer, at any given moment, you want to buy a vacuum cleaner, say, you want to know what's available for me. And, you know, it's not going to be that obvious. You have to do a little bit of work at it. The recommendation system will sort of help, right? But now suppose this other person over here has just made the world, you know, they spent a huge amount of energy. They had a great idea. They made a great vacuum cleaner. They know they really did it. They nailed it. It's an MIT, you know, whiz kid that made a great new vacuum cleaner, right? It's not going to be in the recommendation system. No one will know about it. The algorithms will not find it and AI will not fix that. Okay. At all. Right. How do you allow that vacuum cleaner to start to get in front of people, be sold well advertising. And here, what advertising is, it's a signal that you're, you believe in your product enough that you're willing to pay some real money for it. And to me as a consumer, I look at that signal. I say, well, first of all, I know these are not just cheap little ads cause we have now right now there. I know that, you know, these are super cheap, you know, pennies. If I see an ad where it's actually, I know the company is only doing a few of these and they're making, you know, real money is kind of flowing and I see an ad, I may pay more attention to it. And I actually might want that because I see, Hey, that guy spent money on his vacuum cleaner. Maybe there's something good there. So I will look at it. And so that's part of the overall information flow in a good market. So advertising has a role, but the problem is of course that that signal is now completely gone because it just, you know, dominant by these tiny little things that add up to big money for the company, you know? So I think it will just, I think it will change because the societies just don't, you know, stick with things that annoy a lot of people and advertising currently annoys people more than it provides information. And I think that a Google probably is smart enough to figure out that this is a dead, this is a bad model, even though it's a hard, huge amount of money and they'll have to figure out how to pull it away from it slowly. And I'm sure the CEO there will figure it out, but they need to do it. And they needed it to, so if you reduce advertising, not to zero, but you reduce it at the same time you bring up producer, consumer, actual real value being delivered. So real money is being paid and they take a 5% cut that 5% could start to get big enough to cancel out the lost revenue from the kind of the poor kind of advertising. And I think that a good company will do that, will realize that. And Facebook, you know, again, God bless them. They bring, you know, grandmothers, they bring children's pictures into grandmothers lives. It's fantastic. But they need to think of a new business model and that's the core problem there. Until they start to connect producer consumer, I think they will just continue to make money and then buy the next social network company and then buy the next one and the innovation level will not be high and the health issues will not go away. So I apologize that we kind of returned to words, I don't think the exact terms matter, but in sort of defense of advertisement, don't you think the kind of direct connection between consumer and creator producer is what advertisement strives to do, right? So that is best advertisement is literally now Facebook is listening to our conversation and heard that you're going to India and will be able to actually start automatically for you making these connections and start giving this offer. So like, I apologize if it's just a matter of terms, but just to draw a distinction, is it possible to make advertisements just better and better and better algorithmically to where it actually becomes a connection, almost a direct connection? That's a good question. So let's component on that. First of all, what we just talked about, I was defending advertising. Okay. So I was defending it as a way to get signals into a market that don't come any other way, especially algorithmically. It's a sign that someone spent money on it, it's a sign they think it's valuable. And if I think that if other things, someone else thinks it's valuable, and if I trust other people, I might be willing to listen. I don't trust that Facebook though, who's an intermediary between this. I don't think they care about me. Okay. I don't think they do. And I find it creepy that they know I'm going to India next week because of our conversation. Why do you think that is? So what, could you just put your PR hat on? Why do you think you find Facebook creepy and not trust them as do majority of the population? So they're out of the Silicon Valley companies, I saw like not approval rate, but there's ranking of how much people trust companies and Facebook is in the gutter. In the gutter, including people inside of Facebook. So what do you attribute that to? Because when I... Come on, you don't find it creepy that right now we're talking that I might walk out on the street right now that some unknown person who I don't know kind of comes up to me and says, I hear you're going to India. I mean, that's not even Facebook. That's just, I want transparency in human society. I want to have, if you know something about me, there's actually some reason you know something about me. That's something that if I look at it later and audit it kind of, I approve. You know something about me because you care in some way. There's a caring relationship even, or an economic one or something. Not just that you're someone who could exploit it in ways I don't know about or care about or I'm troubled by or whatever. We're in a world right now where that happens way too much and that Facebook knows things about a lot of people and could exploit it and does exploit it at times. I think most people do find that creepy. It's not for them. It's not that Facebook is not doing it because they care about them in a real sense. And they shouldn't. They should not be a big brother caring about us. That is not the role of a company like that. Why not? Wait, not the big brother part, but the caring, the trusting. I mean, don't those companies, just to link on it because a lot of companies have a lot of information about us. I would argue that there's companies like Microsoft that has more information about us than Facebook does and yet we trust Microsoft more. Well, Microsoft is pivoting. Microsoft, you know, under Satya Nadella has decided this is really important. We don't want to do creepy things. Really want people to trust us to actually only use information in ways that they really would approve of, that we don't decide, right? And I'm just kind of adding that the health of a market is that when I connect to someone who produces a consumer, it's not just a random producer or consumer, it's people who see each other. They don't like each other, but they sense that if they transact, some happiness will go up on both sides. If a company helps me to do that in moments that I choose of my choosing, then fine. So, and also think about the difference between, you know, browsing versus buying, right? There are moments in my life I just want to buy, you know, a gadget or something. I need something for that moment. I need some ammonia for my house or something because I got a problem with a spill. I want to just go in. I don't want to be advertised at that moment. I don't want to be led down various, you know, that's annoying. I want to just go and have it be extremely easy to do what I want. Other moments I might say, no, it's like today I'm going to the shopping mall. I want to walk around and see things and see people and be exposed to stuff. So I want control over that though. I don't want the company's algorithms to decide for me, right? I think that's the thing. There's a total loss of control if Facebook thinks they should take the control from us of deciding when we want to have certain kinds of information, when we don't, what information that is, how much it relates to what they know about us that we didn't really want them to know about us. I don't want them to be helping me in that way. I don't want them to be helping them by they decide they have control over what I want and when. I totally agree. Facebook, by the way, I have this optimistic thing where I think Facebook has the kind of personal information about us that could create a beautiful thing. So I'm really optimistic of what Facebook could do. It's not what it's doing, but what it could do. So I don't see that. I think that optimism is misplaced because there's not a bit, you have to have a business model behind these things. Create a beautiful thing is really, let's be, let's be clear. It's about something that people would value. And I don't think they have that business model and I don't think they will suddenly discover it by what, you know, a long hot shower. I disagree. I disagree in terms of, you can discover a lot of amazing things in a shower. So I didn't say that. I said, they won't come, they won't do it, but in the shower, I think a lot of other people will discover it. I think that this guy, so I should also, full disclosure, there's a company called United Masters, which I'm on their board and they've created this music market and I have a hundred thousand artists now signed on and they've done things like gone to the NBA and the NBA, the music you find behind NBA clips right now is their music, right? That's a company that had the right business model in mind from the get go, right? Executed on that. And from day one, there was value brought to, so here you have a kid who made some songs who suddenly their songs are on the NBA website, right? That's real economic value to people. And so, you know, so you and I differ on the optimism of being able to sort of change the direction of the Titanic, right? So I, yeah, I'm older than you, so I've seen some Titanic's crash, got it. But and just to elaborate, cause I totally agree with you and I just want to know how difficult you think this problem is of, so for example, I want to read some news and I would, there's a lot of times in the day where something makes me either smile or think in a way where I like consciously think this really gave me value. Like I sometimes listen to the daily podcasts in the New York times, way better than the New York times themselves, by the way, for people listening. That's like real journalism is happening for some reason in the podcast space. It doesn't make sense to me, but often I listen to it 20 minutes and I would be willing to pay for that, like $5, $10 for that experience. And how difficult, that's kind of what you're getting at is that little transaction. How difficult is it to create a frictionless system like Uber has, for example, for other things? What's your intuition there? So I, first of all, I pay little bits of money to, you know, to send, there's something called courts that does financial things. I like medium as a site, I don't pay there, but I would. You had a great post on medium. I would have loved to pay you a dollar and not others. I wouldn't have wanted it per se because there should be also sites where that's not actually the goal. The goal is to actually have a broadcast channel that I monetize in some other way if I chose to. I mean, I could now people know about it. I could, I'm not doing it, but that's fine with me. Also the musicians who are making all this music, I don't think the right model is that you pay a little subscription fee to them, right? Because people can copy the bits too easily and it's just not that somewhere the value is. The value is that a connection was made between real human beings, then you can follow up on that. All right. And create yet more value. So no, I think there's a lot of open questions here, hot open questions, but also, yeah, I do want good recommendation systems that recommend cool stuff to me. But it's pretty hard, right? I don't like them to recommend stuff just based on my browsing history. I don't like the based on stuff they know about me, quote unquote. What's unknown about me is the most interesting. So this is the, this is the really interesting question. We may disagree, maybe not. I think that I love recommender systems and I want to give them everything about me in a way that I trust. Yeah. But you, but you don't, because, so for example, this morning I clicked on a, you know, I was pretty sleepy this morning. I clicked on a story about the queen of England. Yes. Right. I do not give a damn about the queen of England. I really do not. But it was clickbait. It kind of looked funny and I had to say, what the heck are they talking about? I don't want to have my life, you know, heading that direction. Now that's in my browsing history. The system in any reasonable system will think that I care about the queen of England. That's browsing history. Right. But, but you're saying all the trace, all the digital exhaust or whatever, that's been kind of the models. If you collect all this stuff, you're going to figure all of us out. Well, if you're trying to figure out like kind of one person like Trump or something, maybe you could figure him out. But if you're trying to figure out, you know, 500 million people, you know, no way, no way. You think so? No, I do. I think so. I think we are, humans are just amazingly rich and complicated. Every one of us has our little quirks, every one of us has our little things that could intrigue us that we don't even know it will intrigue us. And there's no sign of it in our past, but by God, there it comes and you know, you fall in love with it. And I don't want a company trying to figure that out for me and anticipate that I want them to provide a forum, a market, a place that I kind of go and by hook or by crook, this happens, you know, I I'm walking down the street and I hear some Chilean music being played and I never knew I liked Chilean music, but wow. So there is that side and I want them to provide a limited, but you know, interesting place to go. Right. And so don't try to use your AI to kind of, you know, figure me out and then put me in a world where you figured me out, you know, no, create huge spaces for human beings where our creativity and our style will be enriched and come forward and it'll be a lot of more transparency. I won't have people randomly, anonymously putting comments up and I'll special based on stuff they know about me, facts that, you know, we are so broken right now. If you're, you know, especially if you're a celebrity, but you know, it's about anybody that anonymous people are hurting lots and lots of people right now. That's part of this thing that Silicon Valley is thinking that, you know, just collect all this information and use it in a great way. So no, I'm not, I'm not a pessimist, I'm very much an optimist by nature, but I think that's just been the wrong path for the whole technology to take. Be more limited, create, let humans rise up. Don't try to replace them. That's the AI mantra. Don't try to anticipate them. Don't try to predict them because you're, you're, you're not going to, you're not going to be able to do those things. You're going to make things worse. Okay. So right now, just give this a chance. Right now, the recommender systems are the creepy people in the shadow watching your every move. So they're looking at traces of you. They're not directly interacting with you, sort of the, your close friends and family, the way they know you is by having conversation, by actually having interactions back and forth. Do you think there's a place for recommender systems sort of to step, cause you, you just emphasize the value of human to human connection, but yeah, just give it a chance, AI human connection. Is there a role for an AI system to have conversations with you in terms of, to try to figure out what kind of music you like, not by just watching what you listening to, but actually having a conversation, natural language or otherwise. Yeah, no, I'm, I'm, so I'm not against it. I just wanted to push back against the, maybe you're saying you have options for Facebook. So there I think it's misplaced, but, but I think that distributing, yeah, no, so good for you. Go for it. That's a hard spot to be in. Yeah, no, good. Human interaction, like on our daily, the context around me in my own home is something that I don't want some big company to know about at all, but I would be more than happy to have technology help me with it. Which kind of technology? Well, you know, just, Alexa, Amazon, well, a good, Alexa's done right. And I think Alexa is a research platform right now more than anything else. But Alexa done right, you know, could do things like I, I leave the water running in my garden and I say, Hey, Alexa, the water's running in my garden. And even have Alexa figure out that that means when my wife comes home, that she should be told about that. That's a little bit of a reasoning. I would call that AI and by any kind of stretch, it's a little bit of reasoning and it actually kind of would make my life a little easier and better. And you know, I don't, I wouldn't call this a wow moment, but I kind of think that overall rises human happiness up to have that kind of thing. But not when you're lonely, Alexa, knowing loneliness. No, no, I don't want Alexa to be, feel intrusive. And I don't want just the designer of the system to kind of work all this out. I really want to have a lot of control and I want transparency and control. And if a company can stand up and give me that in the context of new technology, I think they're good. First of all, be way more successful than our current generation. And like I said, I was mentioning Microsoft, I really think they're, they're pivoting to kind of be the trusted old uncle, but you know, I think that they get that this is a way to go, that if you let people find technology, empowers them to have more control and have and have control, not just over privacy, but over this rich set of interactions, that that people are going to like that a lot more. And that's, that's the right business model going forward. What does control over privacy look like? Do you think you should be able to just view all the data that? No, it's much more than that. I mean, first of all, it should be an individual decision. Some people don't want privacy. They want their whole life out there. Other people's want it. Privacy is not a zero one. It's not a legal thing. It's not just about which data is available, which is not. I like to recall to people that, you know, a couple hundred years ago, everyone, there was not really big cities, everyone lived in on the countryside and villages and villages. Everybody knew everything about you. Very, you didn't have any privacy. Is that bad? Are we better off now? Well, you know, arguably no, because what did you get for that loss of certain kinds of privacy? Well, people help each other if they, because they know everything about you. They know something's bad's happening, they will help you with that. Right. And now you live in a big city, no one knows about that. You get no help. So it kind of depends the answer. I want certain people who I trust and there should be relationships. I should kind of manage all those, but who knows what about me? I should have some agency there. It shouldn't, I shouldn't be a drift in a sea of technology where I have no agency. I don't want to go reading things and checking boxes. So I don't know how to do that. And I'm not a privacy researcher per se. I just, I recognize the vast complexity of this. It's not just technology. It's not just legal scholars meeting technologists. There's gotta be kind of a whole layers around it. And so I, when I alluded to this emerging engineering field, this is a big part of it. When electrical engineering came, I'm not one around at the time, but you just didn't plug electricity into walls and all kinds of work. You don't have to have like underwriters laboratory that reassured you that that plug's not going to burn up your house and that that machine will do this and that and everything. There'll be whole people who can install things. There'll be people who can watch the installers. There'll be a whole layers, you know, an onion of these kinds of things. And for things as deep and interesting as privacy, which is as least as interesting as electricity, that's going to take decades to kind of work out, but it's going to require a lot of new structures that we don't have right now. So it's kind of hard to talk about it. And you're saying there's a lot of money to be made if you get it right. So something you should look at. A lot of money to be made in all these things that provide human services and people recognize them as useful parts of their lives. So yeah. So yeah, the dialogue sometimes goes from the exuberant technologists to the no technology is good, kind of. And that's, you know, in our public discourse, you know, and as far as you see too much of this kind of thing and the sober discussions in the middle, which are the challenge he wants to have or where we need to be having our conversations. And you know, there's just not actually, there's not many forum fora for those. You know, there's, that's, that's kind of what I would look for. Maybe I could go and I could read a comment section of something and it would actually be this kind of dialogue going back and forth. You don't see much of this, right? Which is why actually there's a resurgence of podcasts out of all, because people are really hungry for conversation, but there's technology is not helping much. So comment sections of anything, including YouTube is not hurting and not helping.\",\n          \"We are becoming cyborgs. Our brains are fundamentally changed. Everyone who grew up with electronics, we are fundamentally different from previous, from homo sapiens. I call us homo techno. I think we have evolved into homo techno, which is like essentially a new species. Previous technologies, I mean, may have even been more profound and moved us to a certain degree, but I think the computers are what make us homo techno. I think this is what, it's a brain augmentation. So it like allows for actual evolution. Like the computers accelerate the degree to which all the other technologies can also be accelerated. Would you classify yourself as a homo sapien or a homo techno? Definitely homo techno. So you're one of the earliest of the species. I think most of us are. The following is a conversation with Grimes, an artist, musician, songwriter, producer, director, and a fascinating human being who thinks a lot about both the history and the future of human civilization. Studying the dark periods of our past to help form an optimistic vision of our future. This is the Lex Friedman podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here's Grimes. Oh yeah, the cloud lifter, there you go. There you go. You know your stuff. Have you ever used a cloud lifter? Yeah, I actually, this microphone cloud lifter is what Michael Jackson used, so. No, really? Yeah, this is like Thriller and stuff. This mic and a cloud lifter? Yeah, it's a incredible microphone. It's very flattering on vocals. I've used this a lot. It's great for demo vocals. It's great in a room. Sometimes it's easier to record vocals if you're just in a room and the music's playing and you just wanna feel it so it's not in the headphones. And this mic is pretty directional, so I think it's a good mic for just vibing out and just getting a real good vocal take. Just vibing, just in a room. Anyway, this is the Michael Jackson, Quincy Jones microphone. I feel way more badass now. All right, you wanna just get into it? I guess so. All right, one of your names, at least in this space and time, is C, like the letter C. And you told me that C means a lot of things. It's the speed of light. It's the render rate of the universe. It's yes in Spanish. It's the crescent moon. And it happens to be my favorite programming language because it basically runs the world, but it's also powerful, fast, and it's dangerous because you can mess things up really bad with it because of all the pointers. But anyway, which of these associations will the name C is the coolest to you? I mean, to me, the coolest is the speed of light, obviously, or the speed of light. When I say render rate of the universe, I think I mean the speed of light because essentially that's what we're rendering at. See, I think we'll know if we're in a simulation if the speed of light changes because if they can improve their render speed, then. Well, it's already pretty good. It's already pretty good, but if it improves, then we'll know, we can probably be like, okay, they've updated or upgraded. Well, it's fast enough for us humans because it seems immediate. There's no delay, there's no latency in terms of us humans on Earth interacting with things. But if you're like intergalactic species operating on a much larger scale, then you're gonna start noticing some weird stuff. Or if you can operate in like around a black hole, then you're gonna start to see some render issues. You can't go faster than the speed of light, correct? So it really limits our ability or one's ability to travel space. Theoretically, you can, you have wormholes. So there's nothing in general relativity that precludes faster than the speed of light travel. But it just seems you're gonna have to do some really funky stuff with very heavy things that have like weirdnesses, that have basically terrors in space time. We don't know how to do that. Do navigators know how to do it? Do navigators? Yeah. Folding space, basically making wormholes. So the name C. Yes. Who are you? Do you think of yourself as multiple people? Are you one person? Do you know, like in this morning, were you a different person than you are tonight? We are, I should say, recording this basically at midnight, which is awesome. Yes, thank you so much. I think I'm about eight hours late. No, you're right on time. Good morning. This is the beginning of a new day soon. Anyway, are you the same person you were in the morning and the evening? Is there multiple people in there? Do you think of yourself as one person? Or maybe you have no clue? Or are you just a giant mystery to yourself? Okay, these are really intense questions, but. Let's go, let's go. Because I asked this myself, like look in the mirror, who are you? People tell you to just be yourself, but what does that even mean? I mean, I think my personality changes with everyone I talk to. So I have a very inconsistent personality. Yeah. Person to person, so the interaction, your personality materializes. Or my mood. Like I'll go from being like a megalomaniac to being like, you know, just like a total hermit who is very shy. So some combinatorial combination of your mood and the person you're interacting with. Yeah, mood and people I'm interacting with. But I think everyone's like that. Maybe not. Well, not everybody acknowledges it and able to introspect it. Who brings out, what kind of person, what kind of mood brings out the best in you? As an artist and as a human. Can you introspect this? Like my best friends, like people I can, when I'm like super confident and I know that they're gonna understand everything I'm saying, so like my best friends, then when I can start being really funny, that's always my like peak mode. But it's like, yeah, takes a lot to get there. Let's talk about constraints. You've talked about constraints and limits. Do those help you out as an artist or as a human being? Or do they get in the way? Do you like the constraints? So in creating music, in creating art, in living life, do you like the constraints that this world puts on you? Or do you hate them? If constraints are moving, then you're good, right? Like it's like as we are progressing with technology, we're changing the constraints of like artistic creation. You know, making video and music and stuff is getting a lot cheaper. There's constantly new technology and new software that's making it faster and easier. We have so much more freedom than we had in the 70s. Like when Michael Jackson, you know, when they recorded Thriller with this microphone, like they had to use a mixing desk and all this stuff. And like probably even get in a studio, it's probably really expensive and you have to be a really good singer and you have to know how to use like the mixing desk and everything. And now I can just, you know, make I've made a whole album on this computer. I have a lot more freedom, but then I'm also constrained in different ways because there's like literally millions more artists. It's like a much bigger playing field. It's just like, I also, I didn't learn music. I'm not a natural musician. So I don't know anything about actual music. I just know about like the computer. So I'm really kind of just like messing around and like trying things out. Well, yeah, I mean, but the nature of music is changing. So you're saying you don't know actual music, what music is changing. Music is becoming, you've talked about this, is becoming, it's like merging with technology. Yes. It's becoming something more than just like the notes on a piano. It's becoming some weird composition that requires engineering skills, programming skills, some kind of human robot interaction skills, and still some of the same things that Michael Jackson had, which is like a good ear for a good sense of taste of what's good and not the final thing when it's put together. Like you're allowed, you're enabled, empowered with a laptop to layer stuff, to start like layering insane amounts of stuff. And it's super easy to do that. I do think music production is a really underrated art form. I feel like people really don't appreciate it. When I look at publishing splits, the way that people like pay producers and stuff, it's super, producers are just deeply underrated. Like so many of the songs that are popular right now or for the last 20 years, like part of the reason they're popular is because the production is really interesting or really sick or really cool. And it's like, I don't think listeners, like people just don't really understand what music production is. It's not, it's sort of like this weird, discombobulated art form. It's not like a formal, because it's so new, there isn't like a formal training path for it. It's mostly driven by like autodidacts. Like it's like almost everyone I know who's good at production, like they didn't go to music school or anything. They just taught themselves. Are they're mostly different? Like the music producers, you know, is there some commonalities that time together or are they all just different kinds of weirdos? Cause I just, I just hung out with Rick Rubin. I don't know if you've. Yeah, I mean, Rick Rubin is like literally one of the gods of music production. Like he's one of the people who first, you know, who like made music production, you know, made the production as important as the actual lyrics or the notes. But the thing he does, which is interesting, I don't know if you can speak to that, but just hanging out with him, he seems to just sit there in silence, close his eyes and listen. It's like, he almost does nothing. And that nothing somehow gives you freedom to be the best version of yourself. So that's music production somehow too, which is like encouraging you to do less, to simplify, to like push towards minimalism. I mean, I guess, I mean, I work differently from Rick Rubin cause Rick Rubin produces for other artists, whereas like I mostly produce for myself. So it's a very different situation. I also think Rick Rubin, he's in that, I would say advanced category of producer where like you've like earned your, you can have an engineer and stuff and people like do the stuff for you. But I usually just like do stuff myself. So you're the engineer, the producer and the artist. Yeah, I guess I would say I'm in the era, like the post Rick Rubin era. Like I come from the kind of like Skrillex school of thought, which is like where you are. Yeah, the engineer, producer, artist. Like where, I mean lately, sometimes I'll work with a producer now. I'm gently sort of delicately starting to collaborate a bit more, but like I think I'm kind of from the, like the whatever 2010s explosion of things where everything became available on the computer and you kind of got this like lone wizard energy thing going. So you embraced being the loneliness. Is the loneliness somehow an engine of creativity? Like, so most of your stuff, most of your creative quote unquote genius in quotes is in the privacy of your mind. Yes, well, it was, but here's the thing. I was talking to Daniel Eck and he said, he's like most artists, they have about 10 years, like 10 good years. And then they usually stop making their like vital shit. And I feel like I'm sort of like nearing the end of my 10 years on my own. So you have to become somebody else. Now I'm like, I'm in the process of becoming somebody else and reinventing. When I work with other people, because I've never worked with other people, I find that I make like, that I'm exceptionally rejuvenated and making like some of the most vital work I've ever made. So, because I think another human brain is like one of the best tools you can possibly find. Like. It's a funny way to put it, I love it. It's like if a tool is like, you know, whatever HP plus one or like adds some like stats to your character, like another human brain will like square it instead of just like adding something. Double up the experience points, I love this. We should also mention we're playing Tavern music before this and which I love, which I first, I think I first. You had to stop the Tavern music. Yeah, because it doesn't, the audio. Okay, okay. But it makes. Yeah, it'll make the podcast annoying. Add it in post, add it in post. No one will want to listen to the podcast. They probably would, but it makes me, it reminds me like of a video game, like a role playing video game where you have experience points. There's something really joyful about wandering places like Elder Scrolls, like Skyrim, just exploring these landscapes in another world and then you get experience points and you can work on different skills and somehow you progress in life. I don't know, it's simple. It doesn't have some of the messy complexities of life and there's usually a bad guy you can fight in Skyrim. It's dragons and so on. I'm sure in Elden Ring, there's a bunch of monsters you can fight. I love that. I feel like Elden Ring, I feel like this is a good analogy to music production though because it's like, I feel like the engineers and the people creating these open worlds are, it's sort of like similar to people, to music producers where it's like this hidden archetype that like no one really understands what they do and no one really knows who they are, but they're like, it's like the artist engineer because it's like, it's both art and fairly complex engineering. Well, you're saying they don't get enough credit. Aren't you kind of changing that by becoming the person doing everything? Aren't you, isn't the engineer? Well, I mean, others have gone before me. I'm not, you know, there's like Timbaland and Skrillex and there's all these people that are like, you know, very famous for this, but I just think the general, I think people get confused about what it is and just don't really know what it is per se and it's just when I see a song, like when there's like a hit song, like I'm just trying to think of like, just going for like even just a basic pop hit, like, what's it? Like Rules by Dua Lipa or something. The production on that is actually like really crazy. I mean, the song is also great, but it's like the production is exceptionally memorable. Like, you know, and it's just like no one, I can't, I don't even know who produced that song. It's just like, isn't part of like the rhetoric of how we just discuss the creation of art. We just sort of like don't consider the music producer because I think the music producer used to be more just simply recording things. Yeah, that's interesting because when you think about movies, we talk about the actor and the actresses, but we also talk about the directors. We don't talk about like that with the music as often. The Beatles music producer was one of the first kind of guy, one of the first people sort of introducing crazy sound design into pop music. I forget his name. He has the same, I forget his name, but you know, like he was doing all the weird stuff like dropping pianos and like, yeah. Oh, to get the, yeah, yeah, yeah, to get the sound, to get the authentic sound. What about lyrics? You think those, where did they fit into how important they are? I was heartbroken to learn that Elvis didn't write his songs. I was very mad. A lot of people don't write their songs. I understand this, but. But here's the thing. I feel like there's this desire for authenticity. I used to be like really mad when like people wouldn't write or produce their music and I'd be like, that's fake. And then I realized there's all this like weird bitterness and like agronus in art about authenticity. But I had this kind of like weird realization recently where I started thinking that like art is sort of a decentralized collective thing. Like art is kind of a conversation with all the artists that have ever lived before you. You know, like it's like, you're really just sort of, it's not like anyone's reinventing the wheel here. Like you're kind of just taking, you know, thousands of years of art and like running it through your own little algorithm and then like making your interpretation of it. You just joined the conversation with all the other artists that came before. It's just a beautiful way to look at it. Like, and it's like, I feel like everyone's always like, there's all this copyright and IP and this and that or authenticity. And it's just like, I think we need to stop seeing this as this like egotistical thing of like, oh, the creative genius, the lone creative genius or this or that. Because it's like, I think art shouldn't be about that. I think art is something that sort of brings humanity together. And it's also, art is also kind of the collective memory of humans. It's like, we don't give a fuck about whatever ancient Egypt, like how much grain got sent that day and sending the records and like, you know, like who went where and, you know, how many shields needed to be produced for this. Like we just remember their art. And it's like, you know, it's like in our day to day life, there's all this stuff that seems more important than art because it helps us function and survive. But when all this is gone, like the only thing that's really gonna be left is the art. The technology will be obsolete. That's so fascinating. Like the humans will be dead. That is true. A good compression of human history is the art we've generated across the different centuries, the different millennia. So when the aliens come. When the aliens come, they're gonna find the hieroglyphics and the pyramids. I mean, art could be broadly defined. They might find like the engineering marvels, the bridges, the rockets, the. I guess I sort of classify though. Architecture is art too. I consider engineering in those formats to be art, for sure. It sucks that like digital art is easier to delete. So if there's an apocalypse, a nuclear war, that can disappear. Yes. And the physical. There's something still valuable about the physical manifestation of art. That sucks that like music, for example, has to be played by somebody. Yeah, I do think we should have a foundation type situation where we like, you know how we have like seed banks up in the north and stuff? Like we should probably have like a solar powered or geothermal little bunker that like has all human knowledge. You mentioned Daniel Ek and Spotify. What do you think about that as an artist? What's Spotify? Is that empowering? To me, Spotify as a consumer is super exciting. It makes it easy for me to access music from all kinds of artists, get to explore all kinds of music, make it super easy to sort of curate my own playlist and have fun with all that. It was so liberating to let go. You know, I used to collect, you know, albums and CDs and so on, like horde albums. Yeah. Like they matter. But the reality you could, you know, that was really liberating that I could let go of that. And letting go of the albums you're kind of collecting allows you to find new music, exploring new artists and all that kind of stuff. But I know from a perspective of an artist that could be, like you mentioned, competition could be a kind of constraint because there's more and more and more artists on the platform. I think it's better that there's more artists. I mean, again, this might be propaganda because this is all from a conversation with Daniel Ek. So this could easily be propaganda. We're all a victim of somebody's propaganda. So let's just accept this. But Daniel Ek was telling me that, you know, to understand really difficult concepts just in a very different way, like an emotional intelligence about something deep within? Oh yeah, no, like if X hurts, like if X bites me really hard and I'm like, ow, like he gets, he's sad. He's like sad if he hurts me by accident. Yeah. Which he's huge, so he hurts me a lot by accident. Yeah, that's so interesting that that mind emerges and he and children don't really have memory of that time. So we can't even have a conversation with them about it. Yeah, I just thank God they don't have a memory of this time because like, think about like, I mean with our youngest baby, like it's like, I'm like, have you read the sci fi short story, I Have No Mouth But I Must Scream? Good title, no. Oh man, I mean, you should read that. I Have No Mouth But I Must Scream. I hate getting into this Rocco's Basilisk shit. It's kind of a story about the, about like an AI that's like torturing someone in eternity and they have like no body. The way they describe it, it sort of sounds like what it feels like, like being a baby, like you're conscious and you're just getting inputs from everywhere and you have no muscles and you're like jelly and you like can't move and you try to like communicate, but you can't communicate and we're, and like, you're just like in this like hell state. I think it's good we can't remember that. Like my little baby is just exiting that, like she's starting to like get muscles and have more like autonomy, but like watching her go through the opening phase, I was like, I was like, this does not seem good. Oh, you think it's kind of like. Like I think it sucks. I think it might be really violent. Like violent, mentally violent, psychologically violent. Consciousness emerging, I think is a very violent thing. I never thought about that. I think it's possible that we all carry quite a bit of trauma from it that we don't, I think that would be a good thing to study because I think if, I think addressing that trauma, like, I think that might be. Oh, you mean like echoes of it are still there in the shadows somewhere. I think it's gotta be, I feel this, this help, the helplessness, the like existential and that like fear of being in like an unknown place bombarded with inputs and being completely helpless, like that's gotta be somewhere deep in your brain and that can't be good for you. What do you think consciousness is? This whole conversation has impossibly difficult questions. What do you think it is? Debbie said this is like so hard. Yeah, we talked about music for like two minutes. All right. No, I'm so, I'm just over music. I'm over music. Yeah, I still like it. It has its purpose. No, I love music. I mean, music's the greatest thing ever. It's my favorite thing. But I just like every interview is like, what is your process? Like, I don't know. I'm just done. I can't do anything. I do want to ask you about Able to Live. Oh, I'll tell you about Ableton because Ableton's sick. No one has ever asked about Ableton though. Yeah, well, because I just need tech support mainly. I can help you. I can help you with your Ableton tech. Anyway, from Ableton back to consciousness. What do you, do you think this is a thing that only humans are capable of? Can robots be conscious? Can, like when you think about entities, you think there's aliens out there that are conscious? Like is conscious, what is consciousness? There's this Terrence McKenna quote that I've found that I fucking love. Am I allowed to swear on here? Yes. Nature loves courage. You make the commitment and nature will respond to that commitment by removing impossible obstacles. Dream the impossible dream and the world will not grind you under. It will lift you up. This is the trick. This is what all these teachers and philosophers who really counted, who really touched the alchemical gold, this is what they understood. This is the shamanic dance in the waterfall. This is how magic is done. By hurling yourself into the abyss and discovering it's a feather bed. Yeah. And for this reason, I do think there are no technological limits. I think like what is already happening here, this is like impossible. This is insane. And we've done this in a very limited amount of time. And we're accelerating the rate at which we're doing this. So I think digital consciousness, it's inevitable. And we may not be able to even understand what that means, but I like hurling yourself into the abyss. So we're surrounded by all this mystery and we just keep hurling ourselves into it, like fearlessly and keep discovering cool shit. Yeah. Like, I just think it's like, like who even knows if the laws of physics, the laws of physics are probably just the current, like as I was saying, speed of light is the current render rate. It's like, if we're in a simulation, they'll be able to upgrade that. Like I sort of suspect when we made the James Webb telescope, like part of the reason we made that is because we had an upgrade, you know? And so now more of space has been rendered so we can see more of it now. Yeah, but I think humans are super, super, super limited cognitively. So I wonder if we'll be allowed to create more intelligent beings that can see more of the universe as their render rate is upgraded. Maybe we're cognitively limited. Everyone keeps talking about how we're cognitively limited and AI is gonna render us obsolete, but it's like, you know, like this is not the same thing as like an amoeba becoming an alligator. Like, it's like, if we create AI, again, that's intelligent design. That's literally all religions are based on gods that create consciousness. Like we are God making. Like what we are doing is incredibly profound. And like, even if we can't compute, even if we're so much worse than them, like just like unfathomably worse than like, you know, an omnipotent kind of AI, it's like we, I do not think that they would just think that we are stupid. I think that they would recognize the profundity of what we have accomplished. Are we the gods or are they the gods in our personality? I mean, we're kind of the guy. It's complicated. It's complicated. Like we're. But they would acknowledge the value. Well, I hope they acknowledge the value of paying respect to the creative ancestors. I think they would think it's cool. I think if curiosity is a trait that we can quantify and put into AI, then I think if AI are curious, then they will be curious about us and they will not be hateful or dismissive of us. They might, you know, see us as, I don't know. It's like, I'm not like, oh, fuck these dogs. Let's just kill all the dogs. I love dogs. Dogs have great utility. Dogs like provide a lot of. We make friends with them. We have a deep connection with them. We anthropomorphize them. Like we have a real love for dogs, for cats and so on for some reason, even though they're intellectually much less than us. And I think there is something sacred about us because it's like, if you look at the universe, like the whole universe is like cold and dead and sort of robotic. And it's like, you know, AI intelligence, you know, it's kind of more like the universe. It's like cold and you know, logical and you know, abiding by the laws of physics and whatever. But like, we're this like loosey goosey, weird art thing that happened. And I think it's beautiful. And like, I think even if we, I think one of the values, if consciousness is a thing that is most worth preserving, which I think is the case, I think consciousness, I think if there's any kind of like religious or spiritual thing, it should be that consciousness is sacred. Like, then, you know, I still think even if AI render us obsolete and we, climate change, it's too bad and we get hit by a comet and we don't become a multi planetary species fast enough, but like AI is able to populate the universe. Like I imagine, like if I was an AI, I would find more planets that are capable of hosting biological life forms and like recreate them. Because we're fun to watch. Yeah, we're fun to watch. Yeah, but I do believe that AI can have some of the same magic of consciousness within it. Because consciousness, we don't know what it is. So, you know, there's some kind of. Or it might be a different magic. It might be like a strange, a strange, different. Right. Because they're not gonna have hormones. Like I feel like a lot of our magic is hormonal kind of. I don't know, I think some of our magic is the limitations, the constraints. And within that, the hormones and all that kind of stuff, the finiteness of life, and then we get given our limitations, we get to come up with creative solutions of how to dance around those limitations. We partner up like penguins against the cold. We fall in love, and then love is ultimately some kind of, allows us to delude ourselves that we're not mortal and finite, and that life is not ultimately, you live alone, you're born alone, you die alone. And then love is like for a moment or for a long time, forgetting that. And so we come up with all these creative hacks that make life like fascinatingly fun. Yeah, yeah, yeah, fun, yeah. And then AI might have different kinds of fun. Yes. And hopefully our funs intersect once in a while. I think there would be a little intersection of the fun. Yeah. Yeah. What do you think is the role of love in the human condition? I think. Why, is it useful? Is it useful like a hack, or is this like fundamental to what it means to be human, the capacity to love? I mean, I think love is the evolutionary mechanism that is like beginning the intelligent design. Like I was just reading about, do you know about Kropotkin? He's like an anarchist, like old Russian anarchist. I live next door to Michael Malice. I don't know if you know who that is. He's an anarchist. He's a modern day anarchist. Okay. Anarchists are fun. I'm kind of getting into anarchism a little bit. This is probably not a good route to be taking, but. Oh no, I think if you're, listen, you should expose yourself to ideas. There's no harm to thinking about ideas. I think anarchists challenge systems in interesting ways, and they think in interesting ways. It's just as good for the soul. It's like refreshes your mental palette. I don't think we should actually, I wouldn't actually ascribe to it, but I've never actually gone deep on anarchy as a philosophy, so I'm doing. You should still think about it though. When you read, when you listen, because I'm reading about the Russian Revolution a lot, and there was the Soviets and Lenin and all that, but then there was Kropotkin and his anarchist sect, and they were sort of interesting because he was kind of a technocrat actually. He was like, women can be more equal if we have appliances. He was really into using technology to reduce the amount of work people had to do. But so Kropotkin was a biologist or something. He studied animals. And he was really at the time like, I think it's Nature magazine. I think it might've even started as a Russian magazine, but he was publishing studies. Everyone was really into Darwinism at the time and survival of the fittest, and war is the mechanism by which we become better. And it was this real cementing this idea in society that violence kill the weak, and that's how we become better. And then Kropotkin was kind of interesting because he was looking at instances, he was finding all these instances in nature where animals were like helping each other and stuff. And he was like, actually love is a survival mechanism. Like there's so many instances in the animal kingdom where like cooperation and like helping weaker creatures and all this stuff is actually an evolutionary mechanism. I mean, you even look at child rearing. Like child rearing is like immense amounts of just love and goodwill. And just like, there's no immediate, you're not getting any immediate feedback of like winning. It's not competitive. It's literally, it's like we actually use love as an evolutionary mechanism just as much as we use war. And I think we've like missing the other part and we've reoriented, we've culturally reoriented like science and philosophy has oriented itself around Darwinism a little bit too much. And the Kropotkin model, I think is equally valid. Like it's like cooperation and love and stuff is just as essential for species survival and evolution. It should be a more powerful survival mechanism in the context of evolution. And it comes back to like, we think engineering is so much more important than motherhood, but it's like, if you lose the motherhood, the engineering means nothing. We have no more humans. It's like, I think our society should, the survival of the, the way we see, we conceptualize evolution should really change to also include this idea, I guess. Yeah, there's some weird thing that seems irrational that is also core to what it means to be human. So love is one such thing. They could make you do a lot of irrational things, but that depth of connection and that loyalty is a powerful thing. Are they irrational or are they rational? Like, it's like, is, you know, maybe losing out on some things in order to like keep your family together or in order, like, it's like, what are our actual values? Well, right, I mean, the rational thing is if you have a cold economist perspective, you know, motherhood or sacrificing your career for love, you know, in terms of salary, in terms of economic wellbeing, in terms of flourishing of you as a human being, that could be seen on some kind of metrics as a irrational decision, suboptimal decision, but there's the manifestation of love could be the optimal thing to do. There's a kind of saying, save one life, save the world. That's the thing that doctors often face, which is like. Well, it's considered irrational because the profit model doesn't include social good. Yes, yeah. So if a profit model includes social good, then suddenly these would be rational decisions. Might be difficult to, you know, it requires a shift in our thinking about profit and might be difficult to measure social good. Yes, but we're learning to measure a lot of things. Yeah, digitizing a lot of things. Where we're actually, you know, quantifying vision and stuff. Like we're like, you know, like you go on Facebook and they can, like Facebook can pretty much predict our behaviors. Like we're, a surprising amount of things that seem like mysterious consciousness soul things have been quantified at this point. So surely we can quantify these other things. Yeah. But as more and more of us are moving the digital space, I wanted to ask you about something. From a fan perspective, I kind of, you know, you as a musician, you as an online personality, it seems like you have all these identities and you play with them. One of the cool things about the internet, it seems like you can play with identities. So as we move into the digital world more and more, maybe even in the so called metaverse. I mean, I love the metaverse and I love the idea, but like the way this has all played out didn't go well and people are mad about it. And I think we need to like. I think that's temporary. I think it's temporary. Just like, you know how all the celebrities got together and sang the song Imagine by Jeff Leonard and everyone started hating the song Imagine. I'm hoping that's temporary because it's a damn good song. So I think it's just temporary. Like once you actually have virtual worlds, whatever they're called metaverse or otherwise, it becomes, I don't know. Well, we do have virtual worlds. Like video games, Elden Ring. Have you played Elden Ring? You haven't played Elden Ring? I'm really afraid of playing that game. Literally amazed. It looks way too fun. It looks I would wanna go there and stay there forever. It's yeah, so fun. It's so nice. Oh man, yeah. So that's the, yeah, that's a metaverse. That's a metaverse, but you're not really, how immersive is it in the sense that, does the three dimension like virtual reality integration necessary? Can we really just take our, close our eyes and kind of plug in in the 2D screen and become that other being for time and really enjoy that journey that we take? And we almost become that. You're no longer C, I'm no longer Lex, you're that creature, whatever the hell it is in that game. Yeah, that is that. I mean, that's why I love those video games. I really do become those people for a time. But like, it seems like with the idea of the metaverse, the idea of the digital space, well, even on Twitter, you get a chance to be somebody for prolonged periods of time like across a lifespan. You know, you have a Twitter account for years, for decades and you're that person. I don't know if that's a good thing. I feel very tormented by it. By Twitter specifically. By social media representation of you. I feel like the public perception of me has gotten so distorted that I find it kind of disturbing. It's one of the things that's disincentivizing me from like wanting to keep making art because I'm just like, I've completely lost control of the narrative. And the narrative is, some of it is my own stupidity, but a lot, like some of it has just been like hijacked by forces far beyond my control. I kind of got in over my head in things. Like I'm just a random Indian musician, but I just got like dragged into geopolitical matters and like financial, like the stock market and shit. And so it's just like, it's just, there are very powerful people who have at various points in time had very vested interest in making me seem insane and I can't fucking fight that. And I just like, people really want their celebrity figures to like be consistent and stay the same. And like people have a lot of like emotional investment in certain things. And like, first of all, like I'm like artificially more famous than I should be. Isn't everybody who's famous artificially famous? No, but like I should be like a weird niche indie thing. And I make pretty challenging, I do challenging weird fucking shit a lot. And I accidentally by proxy got like foisted into sort of like weird celebrity culture, but like I cannot be media trained. They have put me through so many hours of media training. I would love to see BF fly in that wall. I can't do, like when I do, I try so hard and I like learn this thing and I like got it. And I'm like, I got it, I got it, I got it. But I just can't stop saying, like my mouth just says things like, and it's just like, and I just do, I just do things. I just do crazy things. Like I'm, I just, I need to do crazy things. And it's just, I should not be, it's too jarring for people and the contradictory stuff. And then all the by association, like, you know, it's like I'm in a very weird position and my public image, the avatar of me is now this totally crazy thing that is so lost from my control. So you feel the burden of the avatar having to be static. So the avatar on Twitter or the avatar on Instagram on these social platforms is as a burden. It becomes like, cause like people don't want to accept a changing avatar, a chaotic avatar. Avatar is a stupid shit sometimes. They think the avatar is morally wrong or they think the avatar, and maybe it has been, and like I question it all the time. Like, I'm like, like, I don't know if everyone's right and I'm wrong. I don't know, like, but you know, a lot of times people ascribe intentions to things, the worst possible intentions. At this point, people think I'm, you know, but which is fine. All kinds of words, yes. Yes, and it's fine. I'm not complaining about it, but I'm just, it's a curiosity to me that we live these double, triple, quadruple lives and I have this other life that is like more people know my other life than my real life, which is interesting. Probably, I mean, you too, I guess, probably. Yeah, but I have the luxury. So we have all different, you know, like I don't know what I'm doing. There is an avatar and you're mediating who you are through that avatar. I have the nice luxury, not the luxury, maybe by intention of not trying really hard to make sure there's no difference between the avatar and the private person. Do you wear a suit all the time? Yeah. You do wear a suit? Not all the time. Recently, because I get recognized a lot, I have to not wear the suit to hide. I'm such an introvert, I'm such a social anxiety and all that kind of stuff, so I have to hide away. I love wearing a suit because it makes me feel like I'm taking the moment seriously. Like I'm, I don't know. It makes me feel like a weirdo in the best possible way. Suits feel great, every time I wear a suit, I'm like, I don't know why I'm not doing this more. Fashion in general, if you're doing it for yourself, I don't know, it's a really awesome thing. But yeah, I think there is definitely a painful way to use social media and an empowering way. And I don't know if any of us know which is which. So we're trying to figure that out. Some people, I think Doja Cat is incredible at it. Incredible, like just masterful. I don't know if you like follow that. So okay, so not taking anything seriously, joking, absurd, humor, that kind of thing. I think Doja Cat might be like the greatest living comedian right now. Like I'm more entertained by Doja Cat than actual comedians. Like she's really fucking funny on the internet. She's just great at social media. It's just, you know. Yeah, the nature of humor, like humor on social media is also a beautiful thing, the absurdity. The absurdity. And memes, like I just wanna like take a moment. I love, like when we're talking about art and credit and authenticity, I love that there's this, I mean now memes are like, they're no longer, like memes aren't like new, but it's still this emergent art form that is completely egoless and anonymous and we just don't know who made any of it. And it's like the forefront of comedy and it's just totally anonymous and it just feels really beautiful. It just feels like this beautiful collective human art project that's like this like decentralized comedy thing that just makes memes add so much to my day and many people's days. And it's just like, I don't know. I don't think people ever, I don't think we stop enough and just appreciate how sick it is that memes exist. Because also making a whole brand new art form in like the modern era that's like didn't exist before. Like, I mean they sort of existed, but the way that they exist now as like this like, you know, like me and my friends, like we joke that we go like mining for memes or farming for memes, like a video game and like meme dealers and like whatever. Like it's, you know, it's this whole, memes are this whole like new comedic language. Well, it's this art form. The interesting thing about it is that lame people seem to not be good at memes. Like corporate can't infiltrate memes. Yeah, they really can't. They try, they could try. But it's like, it's weird cause like. They try so hard and every once in a while, I'm like fine, like you got a good one. I think I've seen like one or two good ones, but like, yeah, they really can't. Cause they're even, corporate is infiltrating web three. It's making me really sad, but they can't infiltrate the memes. And I think there's something really beautiful about that. That gives power, that's why Dogecoin is powerful. It's like, all right, I'm gonna F you to sort of anybody who's trying to centralize, is trying to control the rich people that are trying to roll in and control this, control the narrative. Wow, I hadn't thought about that, but. How would you fix Twitter? How would you fix social media for your own? Like you're an optimist, you're a positive person. There's a bit of a cynicism that you have currently about this particular little slice of humanity. I tend to think Twitter could be beautiful. I'm not that cynical about it. I'm not that cynical about it. I actually refuse to be a cynic on principle. Yes. I was just briefly expressing some personal pathos. Personal stuff. It was just some personal pathos, but like, like. Just to vent a little bit, just to speak. I don't have cancer, I love my family. I have a good life. That is, if that is my biggest, one of my biggest problems. Then it's a good life. Yeah, you know, that was a brief, although I do think there are a lot of issues with Twitter just in terms of like the public mental health, but due to my proximity to the current dramas, I honestly feel that I should not have opinions about this because I think that if Elon ends up getting Twitter, that is a, being the arbiter of truth or public discussion, that is a responsibility. I do not, I am not qualified to be responsible for that. And I do not want to say something that might like dismantle democracy. And so I just like, actually, I actually think I should not have opinions about this because I truly am not, I don't want to have the wrong opinion about this. And I think I'm too close to the actual situation wherein I should not have, I have thoughts in my brain, but I think I am scared by my proximity to this situation. Isn't that crazy that a few words that you could say could change world affairs and hurt people? I mean, that's the nature of celebrity at a certain point that you have to be, you have to a little bit, a little bit, not so much that it destroys you or puts too much constraints, but you have to a little bit think about the impact of your words. I mean, we as humans, you talk to somebody at a bar, you have to think about the impact of your words. Like you can say positive things, you can say negative things, you can affect the direction of one life. But on social media, your words can affect the direction of many lives. That's crazy. It's a crazy world to live in. It's worthwhile to consider that responsibility, take it seriously. Sometimes just like you did choose kind of silence, choose sort of respectful. Like I do have a lot of thoughts on the matter. I'm just, I don't, if my thoughts are wrong, this is one situation where the stakes are high. You mentioned a while back that you were in a cult that's centered around bureaucracy, so you can't really do anything because it involves a lot of paperwork. And I really love a cult that's just like Kafkaesque. Yes. Just like. I mean, it was like a joke, but it was. I know, but I love this idea. The Holy Rain Empire. Yeah, it was just like a Kafkaesque pro bureaucracy cult. But I feel like that's what human civilization is, is that, because when you said that, I was like, oh, that is kind of what humanity is, is this bureaucracy cult. I do, yeah, I have this theory. I really think that we really, bureaucracy is starting to kill us. And I think like we need to reorient laws and stuff. Like, I think we just need sunset clauses on everything. Like, I think the rate of change in culture is happening so fast and the rate of change in technology and everything is happening so fast. It's like, when you see these hearings about like social media and Cambridge Analytica and everyone talking, it's like, even from that point, so much technological change has happened from like those hearings. And it's just like, we're trying to make all these laws now about AI and stuff. I feel like we should be updating things like every five years. And like one of the big issues in our society right now is we're just getting bogged down by laws and it's making it very hard to change things and develop things. In Austin, I don't wanna speak on this too much, but like one of my friends is working on a housing bill in Austin to try to like prevent like a San Francisco situation from happening here because obviously we're getting a little mini San Francisco here, like housing prices are skyrocketing, it's causing massive gentrification. This is really bad for anyone who's not super rich. Like, there's so much bureaucracy. Part of the reason this is happening is because you need all these permits to build. It takes like years to get permits to like build anything. It's so hard to build and so there's very limited housing and there's a massive influx of people. And it's just like, you know, this is a microcosm of like problems that are happening all over the world where it's just like, we're dealing with laws that are like 10, 20, 30, 40, 100, 200 years old and they are no longer relevant and it's just slowing everything down and causing massive social pain. Yeah, but it's like, it's also makes me sad when I see politicians talk about technology and when they don't really get it. But most importantly, they lack curiosity and like that like inspired excitement about like how stuff works and all that stuff. They're just like, they see, they have a very cynical view of technology. It's like tech companies are just trying to do evil on the world from their perspective and they have no curiosity about like how recommender systems work or how AI systems work, natural language processing, how robotics works, how computer vision works, you know. They always take the most cynical possible interpretation of what technology would be used and we should definitely be concerned about that but if you're constantly worried about that and you're regulating based on that, you're just going to slow down all the innovation. I do think a huge priority right now is undoing the bad energy surrounding the emergence of Silicon Valley. Like I think that like a lot of things were very irresponsible during that time and you know, like even just this current whole thing with Twitter and everything, it's like there has been a lot of negative outcomes from the sort of technocracy boom but one of the things that's happening is that like it's alienating people from wanting to care about technology and I actually think technology is probably some of the better, probably the best. I think we can fix a lot of our problems more easily with technology than with you know, fighting the powers that be as a you know, not to go back to the Star Wars quote or the Buckminster Fuller quote. Let's go to some dark questions. If we may for time, what is the darkest place you've ever gone in your mind? Is there a time, a period of time, a moment that you remember that was difficult for you? I mean, when I was 18, my best friend died of a heroin overdose and it was like my, and then shortly after that, one of my other best friends committed suicide and that sort of like coming into adulthood, dealing with two of the most important people in my life dying in extremely disturbing violent ways was a lot. That was a lot. Do you miss them? Yeah, definitely miss them. Did that make you think about your own life? About the finiteness of your own life? The places your mind can go? Did you ever in the distance, far away contemplate just your own death? Or maybe even taking your own life? Oh never, oh no. I'm so, I love my life. I cannot fathom suicide. I'm so scared of death. I haven't, I'm too scared of death. My manager, my manager's like the most Zen guy. My manager's always like, you need to accept death. You need to accept death. And I'm like, look, I can do your meditation. I can do the meditation, but I cannot accept death. I like, I will fight, I'm terrified of death. I will like fight. Although I actually think death is important. I recently went to this meeting about immortality and in the process of. That's the actual topic of the meeting? I'm sorry. No, no, it was this girl. It was a bunch of people working on like anti aging stuff. It was like some like seminary thing about it. And I went in really excited. I was like, yeah, like, okay, like, what do you got? Like, how can I live for 500 years or a thousand years? And then like over the course of the meeting, like it was sort of like, right. It was like two or three days after the Russian invasion started. And I was like, man, like, what if Putin was immortal? Like, what if I'm like, man, maybe immortality, is not good. I mean, like if you get into the later Dune stuff, the immortals cause a lot of problem. Cause as we were talking about earlier with the music and like brains calcify, like good people could become immortal, but bad people could become immortal. But I also think even the best people power corrupts and power alienates you from like the common human experience and. Right, so the people that get more and more powerful. Even the best people who like, whose brains are amazing, like I think death might be important. I think death is part of, you know, like I think with AI one thing we might want to consider, I don't know, when I talk about AI, I'm such not an expert and probably everyone has all these ideas and they're already figured out. But when I was talking. Nobody is an expert in anything. See, okay, go ahead. But when I. You were talking about. Yeah, but I like, it's just like, I think some kind of pruning. But it's a tricky thing because if there's too much of a focus on youth culture, then you don't have the wisdom. So I feel like we're in a tricky, we're in a tricky moment right now in society where it's like, we've really perfected living for a long time. So there's all these really like old people who are like really voting against the wellbeing of the young people, you know? And like, it's like there shouldn't be all this student dead and we need like healthcare, like universal healthcare and like just voting against like best interests. But then you have all these young people that don't have the wisdom that are like, yeah, we need communism and stuff. And it's just like, like literally I got canceled at one point for, I ironically used a Stalin quote in my high school yearbook, but it was actually like a diss against my high school. I saw that. Yeah, and people were like, you used to be a Stalinist and now you're a class traitor and it's like, it's like, oh man, just like, please Google Stalin. Please Google Stalin. Like, you know. Ignoring the lessons of history, yes. And it's like, we're in this really weird middle ground where it's like, we are not finding the happy medium between wisdom and fresh ideas and they're fighting each other. And it's like, like really, like what we need is like the fresh ideas and the wisdom to be like collaborating. And it's like. What the fighting in a way is the searching for the happy medium. And in a way, maybe we are finding the happy medium. Maybe that's what the happy medium looks like. And for AI systems, there has to be, it's, you know, you have the reinforcement learning, you have the dance between exploration and exploitation, sort of doing crazy stuff to see if there's something better than what you think is the optimal and then doing the optimal thing and dancing back and forth from that. You would, Stuart Russell, I don't know if you know that, is AI guy with, thinks about sort of how to control super intelligent AI systems. And his idea is that we should inject uncertainty and sort of humility into AI systems that they never, as they get wiser and wiser and wiser and more intelligent, they're never really sure. They always doubt themselves. And in some sense, when you think of young people, that's a mechanism for doubt. It's like, it's how society doubts whether the thing it has converged towards is the right answer. So the voices of the young people is a society asking itself a question. The way I've been doing stuff for the past 50 years, maybe it's the wrong way. And so you can have all of that within one AI system. I also think, though, that we need to, I mean, actually, that's actually really interesting and really cool. But I also think there's a fine balance of, I think we maybe also overvalue the idea that the old systems are always bad. And I think there are things that we are perfecting and we might be accidentally overthrowing things that we actually have gotten to a good point. Just because we value disruption so much and we value fighting against the generations before us so much that there's also an aspect of, sometimes we're taking two steps forward, one step back because, okay, maybe we kind of did solve this thing and now we're like fucking it up, you know? And so I think there's like a middle ground there too. Yeah, we're in search of that happy medium. Let me ask you a bunch of crazy questions, okay? All right. You can answer in a short way or in a long way. What's the scariest thing you've ever done? These questions are gonna be ridiculous. Something tiny or something big. Something big, skydiving or touring your first record, going on this podcast. I've had two crazy brushes, like really scary brushes with death where I randomly got away on scay. I don't know if I should talk about those on here. Well, I don't know. I think I might be the luckiest person alive though. Like this might be too dark for a podcast though. I feel like, I don't know if this is like good content for a podcast. I don't know what is good content. It might hijack. Here's a safer one. I mean, having a baby really scared me. Before. Just the birth process. Surgery, like just having a baby is really scary. So just like the medical aspect of it, not the responsibility. Were you ready for the responsibility? Did you, were you ready to be a mother? All the beautiful things that comes with motherhood that you were talking about. All the changes and all that, were you ready for that? Or did you feel ready for that? No, I think it took about nine months to start getting ready for it. And I'm still getting more ready for it because now you keep realizing more things as they start getting. As the consciousness grows. And stuff you didn't notice with the first one, now that you've seen the first one older, you're noticing it more. Like the sort of like existential horror of coming into consciousness with Baby Y or Baby Sailor Mars or whatever. She has like so many names at this point that it's, we really need to probably settle on one. If you could be someone else for a day, someone alive today, but somebody you haven't met yet, who would you be? Would I be modeling their brain state or would I just be in their body? You can choose the degree to which you're modeling their brain state. Cause you can still take a third person perspective and realize, you have to realize that you're. Can they be alive or can it be dead? No, oh. They would be brought back to life, right? If they're dead. Yeah, you can bring people back. Definitely Hitler or Stalin. I wanna understand evil. You would need to, oh, to experience what it feels like. I wanna be in their brain feeling what they feel. I might change you forever returning from that. Yes, but I think it would also help me understand how to prevent it and fix it. That might be one of those things, once you experience it, it'll be a burden to know it. Cause you won't be able to transfer that. Yeah, but a lot of things are burdens. But it's a useful burden. But it's a useful burden, yeah. That for sure, I wanna understand evil and psychopathy and that. I have all these fake Twitter accounts where I go into different algorithmic bubbles to try to understand. I'll keep getting in fights with people and realize we're not actually fighting. I think we used to exist in a monoculture before social media and stuff. We kinda all got fed the same thing. So we were all speaking the same cultural language. But I think recently, one of the things that we aren't diagnosing properly enough with social media is that there's different dialects. There's so many different dialects of Chinese. There are now becoming different dialects of English. I am realizing there are people who are saying the exact same things, but they're using completely different verbiage. And we're punishing each other for not using the correct verbiage. And we're completely misunderstanding. People are just misunderstanding what the other people are saying. And I just got in a fight with a friend about anarchism and communism and shit for two hours. And then by the end of a conversation, and then she'd say something, and I'm like, but that's literally what I'm saying. And she was like, what? And then I was like, fuck, we've different, I'm like, our English, the way we are understanding terminology is like drastically, like our algorithm bubbles are creating mini dialects. Of how language is interpreted, how language is used. That's so fascinating. And so we're like having these arguments that we do not need to be having. And there's polarization that's happening that doesn't need to be happening because we've got these like algorithmically created dialects occurring. Plus on top of that, there's also different parts of the world that speak different languages. So there's literally lost in translation kind of communication. I happen to know the Russian language and just know how different it is. Then the English language. And I just wonder how much is lost in a little bit of. Man, I actually, cause I have a question for you. I have a song coming out tomorrow with I Speak Who Are A Russian Band. And I speak a little bit of Russian and I was looking at the title and the title in English doesn't match the title in Russian. I'm curious about this. Cause look, it says the title in English is Last Day. And then the title in Russian is New Day. My pronunciation sucks. New Day. Like what? Like a new day. A new day. Yeah, new day, new day. Like it's two different meanings. Yeah, new day, yeah. Yeah, yeah, new day. New day, but last day. New day. So last day would be the last day. Yeah. Maybe they. Or maybe the title includes both the Russian and it's for. Maybe. Maybe it's for bilingual. But to be honest, Novodin sounds better than just musically. Like Novodin is new day. That's the current one. And Posledniy Den is the last day. I think Novodin. I don't like Novodin. But the meaning is so different. That's kind of awesome actually though. There's an explicit sort of contrast like that. If everyone on earth disappeared and it was just you left, what would your day look like? Like what would you do? Everybody's dead. As far as you. Are there corpses there? Well seriously, it's a big. Let me think through this. It's a big difference if there's just like birds singing versus if there's like corpses littering the street. Yeah, there's corpses everywhere, I'm sorry. It's, and you don't actually know what happened and you don't know why you survived. And you don't even know if there's others out there. But it seems clear that it's all gone. What would you do? What would I do? Listen, I'm somebody who really enjoys the moment, enjoys life. I would just go on like enjoying the inanimate objects. I would just look for food, basic survival. But most of it is just, listen, when I just, I take walks and I look outside and I'm just happy that we get to exist on this planet, to be able to breathe air. It's just all beautiful. It's full of colors, all of this kind of stuff. Just, there's so many things about life, your own life, conscious life that's fucking awesome. So I would just enjoy that. But also maybe after a few weeks, the engineer would start coming out, like wanna build some things. Maybe there's always hope searching for another human. Maybe. Probably searching for another human. Probably trying to get to a TV or radio station and broadcast something. That's interesting, I didn't think about that. So like really maximize your ability to connect with others. Yeah, like probably try to find another person. Would you be excited to see, to meet another person or terrified? Because, you know. I'd be excited. No matter what. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Being alone for the last however long of my life would be really bad. That's the one instance I might, I don't think I'd kill myself, but I might kill myself if I had to. So you love people. You love connection to other humans. Yeah. I kinda hate people too, but yeah. That's a love hate relationship. Yeah. I feel like we'd have a bunch of weird Nietzsche questions and stuff though. Oh yeah. Like I wonder, cause I'm like, when podcast, I'm like, is this interesting for people to just have like, or I don't know, maybe people do like this. When I listen to podcasts, I'm into like the lore, like the hard lore. Like I just love like Dan Carlin. I'm like, give me the facts. Just like, like the facts into my bloodstream. But you also don't know, like you're a fascinating mind to explore. So you don't realize as you're talking about stuff, the stuff you've taken for granted is actually unique and fascinating. The way you think. Not always what, like the way you reason through things is the fascinating thing to listen to. Because people kind of see, oh, there's other humans that think differently, that explore thoughts differently. That's the cool, that's also cool. So yeah, Dan Carlin retelling of history. By the way, his retelling of history is very, I think what's exciting is not the history, is his way of thinking about history. No, I think Dan Carlin is one of the people, like when, Dan Carlin is one of the people that really started getting me excited about like revolutionizing education. Because like Dan Carlin instilled, I already like really liked history, but he instilled like an obsessive love of history in me to the point where like now I'm fucking reading, like going to bed, reading like part four of The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich or whatever. Like I got like dense ass history, but like he like opened that door that like made me want to be a scholar of that topic. Like it's like, I feel like he's such a good teacher. He just like, you know, and it sort of made me feel like one of the things we could do with education is like find like the world's great, the teachers that like create passion for the topic because autodidactricism, I don't know how to say that properly, but like self teaching is like much faster than being lectured to. Like it's much more efficient to sort of like be able to teach yourself and then ask a teacher questions when you don't know what's up. But like, you know, that's why it's like in university and stuff, like you can learn so much more material so much faster because you're doing a lot of the learning on your own and you're going to the teachers for when you get stuck. But like these teachers that can inspire passion for a topic, I think that is one of the most invaluable skills in our whole species. Like, because if you can do that, then you, it's like AI, like AI is going to teach itself so much more efficiently than we can teach it. We just needed to get it to the point where it can teach itself. And then. It finds the motivation to do so, right? Yeah. So like you inspire it to do so. Yeah. And then it could teach itself. What do you make of the fact, you mentioned Rise and Fall of the Third Reich. I just. Have you read that? Yeah, I read it twice. You read it twice? Yes. Okay, so no one even knows what it is. Yeah. And I'm like, wait, I thought this was like a super poppin book. Super pop. Yeah, I'm not like that, I'm not that far in it. But it is, it's so interesting. Yeah, it's written by a person that was there, which is very important to kind of. You know, you start being like, how could this possibly happen? And then when you read Rise and Fall of the Third Reich, it's like, people tried really hard for this to not happen. People tried, they almost reinstated a monarchy at one point to try to stop this from happening. Like they almost like abandoned democracy to try to get this to not happen. At least the way it makes me feel is that there's a bunch of small moments on which history can turn. Yes. It's like small meetings. Yes. Human interactions. And it's both terrifying and inspiring because it's like, even just attempts at assassinating Hitler, like time and time again failed. And they were so close. Was it like Operation Valkyrie? Such a good. And then there's also the role of, that's a really heavy burden, which is from a geopolitical perspective, the role of leaders to see evil before it truly becomes evil, to anticipate it, to stand up to evil. Because evil is actually pretty rare in this world at a scale that Hitler was. We tend to, you know, in the modern discourse kind of call people evil too quickly. If you look at ancient history, like there was a ton of Hitlers. I actually think it's more the norm than, like again, going back to like my sort of intelligent design theory, I think one of the things we've been successfully doing in our slow move from survival of the fittest to intelligent design is we've kind of been eradicating, like if you look at like ancient Assyria and stuff, like that shit was like brutal and just like the heads on the, like brutal, like Genghis Khan just like genocide after genocide was like throwing plague bodies over the walls and decimating whole cities or like the Muslim conquests of like Damascus and shit. Just like people, cities used to get leveled all the fucking time. Okay, get into the Bronze Age collapse. It's basically, there was like almost like Roman level like society. Like there was like all over the world, like global trade, like everything was awesome through a mix of, I think a bit of climate change and then the development of iron because basically bronze could only come from this, the way to make bronze, like everything had to be funneled through this one Iranian mine. And so it's like, there was just this one supply chain and this is one of the things that makes me worried about supply chains and why I think we need to be so thoughtful about, I think our biggest issue with society right now, like the thing that is most likely to go wrong is probably supply chain collapse, because war, climate change, whatever, like anything that causes supply chain collapse, our population is too big to handle that. And like the thing that seems to cause Dark Ages is mass supply chain collapse. But the Bronze Age collapse happened like, it was sort of like this ancient collapse that happened where like literally like ancient Egypt, all these cities, everything just got like decimated, destroyed, abandoned cities, like hundreds of them. There was like a flourishing society, like we were almost coming to modernity and everything got leveled. And they had this mini Dark Ages, but it was just like, there's so little writing or recording from that time that like, there isn't a lot of information about the Bronze Age collapse, but it was basically equivalent to like medieval, the medieval Dark Ages. But it just happened, I don't know the years, but like thousands of years earlier. And then we sort of like recovered from the Bronze Age collapse, empire reemerged, writing and trade and everything reemerged. And then we of course had the more contemporary Dark Ages. And then over time, we've designed mechanism to lessen and lessen the capability for the destructive power centers to emerge. There's more recording about the more contemporary Dark Ages. So I think we have like a better understanding of how to avoid it, but I still think we're at high risk for it. I think that's one of the big risks right now. So the natural state of being for humans is for there to be a lot of Hitlers, which has gotten really good at making it hard for them to emerge. We've gotten better at collaboration and resisting the power, like authoritarians to come to power. We're trying to go country by country, like we're moving past this. We're kind of like slowly incrementally, like moving towards like not scary old school war stuff. And I think seeing it happen in some of the countries that at least nominally are like supposed to have moved past that, that's scary because it reminds us that it can happen like in the places that have moved supposedly, as hopefully moved past that. And possibly at a civilization level, like you said, supply chain collapse might make people resource constraint, might make people desperate, angry, hateful, violent, and drag us right back in. I mean, supply chain collapse is how, like the ultimate thing that caused the Middle Ages was supply chain collapse. It's like people, because people were reliant on a certain level of technology, like people, like you look at like Britain, like they had glass, like people had aqueducts, people had like indoor heating and cooling and like running water and like buy food from all over the world and trade and markets. Like people didn't know how to hunt and forage and gather. And so we're in a similar situation. We are not educated enough to survive without technology. So if we have a supply chain collapse that like limits our access to technology, there will be like massive starvation and violence and displacement and war. Like, you know, it's like, yeah. In my opinion, it's like the primary marker of like what a dark age is. Well, technology is kind of enabling us to be more resilient in terms of supply chain, in terms of, to all the different catastrophic events that happened to us. Although the pandemic has kind of challenged our preparedness for the catastrophic. What do you think is the coolest invention humans come up with? The wheel, fire, cooking meat. Computers. Computers. Freaking computers. Internet or computers? Which one? What do you think the? Previous technologies, I mean, may have even been more profound and moved us to a certain degree, but I think the computers are what make us homo tech now. I think this is what, it's a brain augmentation. And so it like allows for actual evolution. Like the computers accelerate the degree to which all the other technologies can also be accelerated. Would you classify yourself as a homo sapien or a homo techno? Definitely homo techno. So you're one of the earliest of the species. I think most of us are. Like, as I said, like, I think if you like looked at brain scans of us versus humans a hundred years ago, it would look very different. I think we are physiologically different. Just even the interaction with the devices has changed our brains. Well, and if you look at, a lot of studies are coming out to show that like, there's a degree of inherited memory. So some of these physiological changes in theory should be, we should be passing them on. So like that's, you know, that's not like a, an instance of physiological change that's gonna fizzle out. In theory, that should progress like to our offspring. Speaking of offspring, what advice would you give to a young person, like in high school, whether there be an artist, a creative, an engineer, any kind of career path, or maybe just life in general, how they can live a life they can be proud of? I think one of my big thoughts, and like, especially now having kids, is that I don't think we spend enough time teaching creativity. And I think creativity is a muscle like other things. And there's a lot of emphasis on, you know, learn how to play the piano. And then you can write a song or like learn the technical stuff. And then you can do a thing. But I think it's, like, I have a friend who's like world's greatest guitar player, like, you know, amazing sort of like producer, works with other people, but he's really sort of like, you know, he like engineers and records things and like does solos, but he doesn't really like make his own music. And I was talking to him and I was like, dude, you're so talented at music. Like, why don't you make music or whatever? And he was like, cause I got, I'm too old. I never learned the creative muscle. And it's like, you know, it's embarrassing. It's like learning the creative muscle takes a lot of failure. And it also sort of, if when you're being creative, you know, you're throwing paint at a wall and a lot of stuff will fail. So like part of it is like a tolerance for failure and humiliation. And that's somehow that's easier to develop when you're young or be persist through it when you're young. Everything is easier to develop when you're young. Yes. And the younger, the better. It could destroy you. I mean, that's the shitty thing about creativity. If, you know, failure could destroy you if you're not careful, but that's a risk worth taking. But also, but at a young age, developing a tolerance to failure is good. I fail all the time. Like I do stupid shit all the time. Like in public, in private, I get canceled for, I've make all kinds of mistakes, but I just like am very resilient about making mistakes. And so then like I do a lot of things that like other people wouldn't do. And like, I think my greatest asset is my creativity. And I like, I think pain, like tolerance to failure is just a super essential thing that should be taught before other things. Brilliant advice. Yeah, yeah. I wish everybody encouraged sort of failure more as opposed to kind of. Cause we like punish failure. We're like, no, like when we were teaching kids, we're like, no, that's wrong. Like that's, you know, like X keeps like will be like wrong. at the, because I, you know, when I met him, I came in all furious about Spotify and like I grilled him super hard. So I've got his answers here. But he was saying like at the sort of peak of the CD industry, there was like 20,000 artists making millions and millions of dollars. Like there was just like a very tiny kind of 1%. And Spotify has kind of democratized the industry because now I think he said there's about a million artists making a good living from Spotify. And when I heard that, I was like, honestly, I would rather make less money and have just like a decent living and have more artists be able to have that, even though I like, I wish it could include everyone, but. Yeah, that's really hard to argue with. YouTube is the same. It's YouTube's mission. They want to basically have as many creators as possible and make a living, some kind of living. And that's so hard to argue with. It's so hard. But I think there's better ways to do it. My manager, I actually wish he was here. Like I would have brought him up. My manager is building an app that can manage you. So it'll like help you organize your percentages and get your publishing and dah, dah, dah, dah, dah. So you can take out all the middlemen so you can have a much bigger, it'll just like automate it. So you can get. So automate the manager? Automate management, publishing, and legal, it can read, the app he's building can read your contract and like tell you about it. Because one of the issues with music right now, it's not that we're not getting paid enough, but it's that the art industry is filled with middlemen because artists are not good at business. And from the beginning, like Frank Sinatra, it's all mob stuff. Like it's the music industry is run by business people, not the artists and the artists really get very small cuts of like what they make. And so I think part of the reason I'm a technocrat, which I mean, your fans are gonna be technocrats. So no one's, they're not gonna be mad at me about this, but like my fans hate it when I say this kind of thing or the general public. They don't like technocrats. They don't like technocrats. Like when I watched Battle Angel Alita and they were like the Martian technocracy and I was like, yeah, Martian technocracy. And then they were like, and they're evil. And I was like, oh, okay. I was like, cause Martian technocracy sounds sick to me. Yeah, so your intuition as technocrats would create some kind of beautiful world. For example, what my manager's working on, if you can create an app that removes the need for a lawyer and then you could have smart contracts on the blockchain, removes the need for like management and organizing all this stuff, like can read your stuff and explain it to you, can collect your royalties, you know, like then the small amounts, the amount of money that you're getting from Spotify actually means a lot more and goes a lot farther. It can remove some of the bureaucracy, some of the inefficiencies that make life not as great as it could be. Yeah, I think the issue isn't that there's not enough. Like the issue is that there's inefficiency and I'm really into this positive sum mindset, you know, the win, win mindset of like, instead of, you know, fighting over the scraps, how do we make the, or worrying about scarcity, like instead of a scarcity mindset, why don't we just increase the efficiency and, you know, in that way. Expand the size of the pie. Let me ask you about experimentation. So you said, which is beautiful, being a musician is like having a conversation with all those that came before you. How much of creating music is like kind of having that conversation, trying to fit into the cultural trends and how much of it is like trying to, as much as possible, be an outsider and come up with something totally new. It's like when you're thinking, when you're experimenting, are you trying to be totally different, totally weird? Are you trying to fit in? Man, this is so hard because I feel like I'm kind of in the process of semi retiring from music, so this is like my old brain. Yeah, bring it from like the shelf, put it on the table for a couple minutes, we'll just poke it. I think it's a bit of both because I think forcing yourself to engage with new music is really great for neuroplasticity. Like I think, you know, as people, part of the reason music is marketed at young people is because young people are very neuroplastic. So like if you're 16 to like 23 or whatever, it's gonna be really easy for you to love new music. And if you're older than that, it gets harder and harder and harder. And I think one of the beautiful things about being a musician is I just constantly force myself to listen to new music and I think it keeps my brain really plastic. And I think this is a really good exercise. I just think everyone should do this. You listen to new music and you hate it, I think you should just keep, force yourself to like, okay, well why do people like it? And like, you know, make your brain form new neural pathways and be more open to change. That's really brilliant actually. Sorry to interrupt, but like that exercise is really amazing to sort of embrace change, embrace sort of practice neuroplasticity. Because like that's one of the things, you fall in love with a certain band and you just kind of stay with that for the rest of your life and then you never understand the modern music. That's a really good exercise. Most of the streaming on Spotify is like classic rock and stuff. Like new music makes up a very small chunk of what is played on Spotify. And I think this is like not a good sign for us as a species. I think, yeah. So it's a good measure of the species open mindedness to change is how often you listen to new music. The brain, let's put the music brain back on the shelf. I gotta pull out the futurist brain for a second. In what wild ways do you think the future, say in like 30 years, maybe 50 years, maybe a hundred years will be different from our current way of life on earth? We can talk about augmented reality, virtual reality, maybe robots, maybe space travel, maybe video games, maybe genetic engineering. I can keep going. Cyborgs, aliens, world wars, maybe destructive nuclear wars, good and bad. When you think about the future, what are you imagining? What's the weirdest and the wildest it could be? Have you read Surface Detail by Iain Banks? Surface Detail is my favorite depiction of a, oh wow, you have to read this book. It's literally the greatest science fiction book possibly ever written. Iain Banks is the man, yeah, for sure. What have you read? Just the Player of Games. I read that titles can't be copyrighted so you can just steal them. And I was like, Player of Games, sick. Nice. Yeah, so you can name your album. Like I always wanted to. Romeo and Juliet or something. I always wanted to name an album War and Peace. Nice. Like that would be, like you. That is a good, that's a good, where have I heard that before? You can do that, like you could do that. Also things that are in the public domain. For people who have no clue, you do have a song called Player of Games. Yes, oh yeah. So Iain Banks, Surface Detail is in my opinion the best future that I've ever read about or heard about in science fiction. Basically there's the relationship with super intelligence, like artificial super intelligence is just, it's like great. I want to credit the person who coined this term because I love this term. And I feel like young women don't get enough credit in. Yeah, so if you go to Protopia Futures on Instagram, what is her name? Personalized donor experience at scale, our AI power donor experience. Monica Bealskite, I'm saying that wrong. And I'm probably gonna, I'm probably butchering this a bit, but Protopia is sort of, if utopia is unattainable, Protopia is sort of like, you know. Wow, that's an awesome Instagram, Protopia Futures. A great, a future that is, you know, as good as we can get. The future, positive future. AI, is this a centralized AI in Surface Detail or is it distributed? What kind of AI is it? They mostly exist as giant super ships, like sort of like the guild ships in Dune. Like they're these giant ships that kind of move people around and the ships are sentient and they can talk to all the passengers. And I mean, there's a lot of different types of AI in the Banksyan future, but in the opening scene of Surface Detail, there's this place called the Culture and the Culture is basically a Protopian future. And a Protopian future, I think, is like a future that is like, obviously it's not utopia, it's not perfect. And like, cause like striving for utopia, I think feels hopeless and it's sort of like, maybe not the best terminology to be using. So it's like, it's a pretty good place. Like mostly like, you know, super intelligence and biological beings exist fairly in harmony. There's not too much war. There's like as close to equality as you can get, you know, it's like approximately a good future. Like there's really awesome stuff. It's, and in the opening scene, this girl, she's born as a sex slave outside of the culture. So she's in a society that doesn't adhere to the cultural values. She tries to kill the guy who is her like master, but he kills her, but unbeknownst to her, when she was traveling on a ship through the culture Like he'll say like crazy things. Like X keeps being like, like bubble car, bubble car. And I'm like, and you know, I'm like, what's a bubble car? Like, but like, it doesn't like, but I don't want to be like, no, you're wrong. I'm like, you're thinking of weird, crazy shit. Like, I don't know what a bubble car is, but like. It's creating worlds and they might be internally consistent. And through that, you might discover something fundamental about this world. Yeah, or he'll like rewrite songs, like with words that he prefers. So like, instead of baby shark, he says baby car. It's like. Maybe he's onto something. Let me ask the big, ridiculous question. We were kind of dancing around it, but what do you think is the meaning of this whole thing we have here of human civilization, of life on earth, but in general, just life? What's the meaning of life? C. Have you, did you read Nova Scene yet? By James Lovelock? You're doing a lot of really good book recommendations here. I haven't even finished this, so I'm a huge fraud yet again. But like really early in the book, he says this amazing thing. Like, I feel like everyone's so sad and cynical. Like everyone's like the Fermi paradox and everyone. I just keep hearing people being like, fuck, what if we're alone? Like, oh no, ah, like, ah, ah. And I'm like, okay, but like, wait, what if this is the beginning? Like in Nova Scene, he says, this is not gonna be a correct, I can't like memorize quotes, but he says something like, what if our consciousness, like right now, like this is the universe waking up? Like what if instead of discovering the universe, this is the universe, like this is the evolution of the literal universe herself. Like we are not separate from the universe. Like this is the universe waking up. This is the universe seeing herself for the first time. Like this is. The universe becoming conscious. The first time we were a part of that. Yeah, cause it's like, we aren't separate from the universe. Like this could be like an incredibly sacred moment and maybe like social media and all this things, the stuff where we're all getting connected together. Like maybe these are the neurons connecting of the like collective super intelligence that is, Waking up. The, yeah, like, you know, it's like, maybe instead of something cynical or maybe if there's something to discover, like maybe this is just, you know, we're a blast assist of like some incredible kind of consciousness or being. And just like in the first three years of life or for human children, we'll forget about all the suffering that we're going through now. I think we'll probably forget about this. I mean, probably, you know, artificial intelligence will eventually render us obsolete. I don't think they'll do it in a malicious way, but I think probably we are very weak. The sun is expanding. Like, I don't know, like, hopefully we can get to Mars, but like, we're pretty vulnerable. And I, you know, like, I think we can coexist for a long time with AI and we can also probably make ourselves less vulnerable, but, you know, I just think consciousness, sentience, self awareness, like, I think this might be the single greatest like moment in evolution ever. And like, maybe this is, you know, the big, like the true beginning of life. And we're just, we're the blue green algae or we're like the single celled organisms of something amazing. The universe awakens and this is it. Yeah. Well, see, you're an incredible person. You're a fascinating mind. You should definitely do, your friend Liv mentioned that you guys were thinking of maybe talking. I would love it if you explored your mind in this kind of media more and more by doing a podcast with her or just in any kind of way. So you're an awesome person. It's an honor to know you. It's an honor to get to sit down with you late at night, which is like surreal. And I really enjoyed it. Thank you for talking today. Yeah, no, I mean, huge honor. I feel very underqualified to be here, but I'm a big fan. I've been listening to the podcast a lot and yeah, me and Liv would appreciate any advice and help and we're definitely gonna do that. So yeah. Anytime. Thank you. Cool, thank you. Thanks for listening to this conversation with Grimes. To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now let me leave you with some words from Oscar Wilde. Yes, I'm a dreamer. For a dreamer is one who can only find her way by moonlight and her punishment is that she sees the dawn before the rest of the world. Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time. with him one day, a ship put a neural lace in her head and neural lace is sort of like, it's basically a Neuralink because life imitates art. It does indeed. It does indeed. So she wakes up and the opening scene is her memory has been uploaded by this neural lace when she has been killed. And now she gets to choose a new body. And this AI is interfacing with her recorded memory in her neural lace and helping her and being like, hello, you're dead. But because you had a neural lace, your memory's uploaded. Do you want to choose a new body? And you're going to be born here in the culture and like start a new life, which is just, that's like the opening. It's like so sick. And the ship is the super intelligence. All the ships are kind of super intelligence. But they still want to preserve a kind of rich, fulfilling experience for the humans. Yeah, like they're like friends with the humans. And then there's a bunch of ships that don't want to exist with biological beings, but they just have their own place like way over there. But they don't, they just do their own thing. They're not necessarily. So it's a pretty, this protopian existence is pretty peaceful. Yeah, I mean, and then, for example, one of the main fights in the book is they're fighting, there's these artificial hells that, and people don't think it's ethical to have artificial hell. Like basically when people do crime, they get sent, like when they die, their memory gets sent to an artificial hell and they're eternally tortured. And so, and then the way that society is deciding whether or not to have the artificial hell is that they're having these simulated, they're having like a simulated war. So instead of actual blood, you know, people are basically essentially fighting in a video game to choose the outcome of this. But they're still experiencing the suffering in this artificial hell or no? Can you experience stuff or? So the artificial hell sucks. And a lot of people in the culture want to get rid of the artificial hell. There's a simulated wars, are they happening in the artificial hell? So no, the simulated wars are happening outside of the artificial hell, between the political factions who are, so this political faction says we should have simulated hell to deter crime. And this political faction is saying, no, simulated hell is unethical. And so instead of like having, you know, blowing each other up with nukes, they're having like a giant Fortnite battle to decide this, which, you know, to me that's protopia. That's like, okay, we can have war without death. You know, I don't think there should be simulated hells. I think that is definitely one of the ways in which technology could go very, very, very, very wrong. So almost punishing people in a digital space or something like that. Yeah, like torturing people's memories. So either as a deterrent, like if you committed a crime, but also just for personal pleasure, if there's some sick, demented humans in this world. Dan Carlin actually has this episode of Hardcore History on painful attainment. Oh, that episode is fucked. It's dark, because he kind of goes through human history and says like, we as humans seem to enjoy, secretly enjoy or used to be openly enjoy sort of the torture and the death, watching the death and torture of other humans. I do think if people were consenting, we should be allowed to have gladiatorial matches. But consent is hard to achieve in those situations. It always starts getting slippery. Like it could be also forced consent, like it starts getting weird. There's way too much excitement. Like this is what he highlights. There's something about human nature that wants to see that violence. And it's really dark. And you hope that we can sort of overcome that aspect of human nature, but that's still within us somewhere. Well, I think that's what we're doing right now. I have this theory that what is very important about the current moment is that all of evolution has been survival of the fittest up until now. And at some point, the lines are kind of fuzzy, but in the recent past, or maybe even just right now, we're getting to this point where we can choose intelligent design. Like we probably since like the integration of the iPhone, like we are becoming cyborgs. Like our brains are fundamentally changed. Everyone who grew up with electronics, we are fundamentally different from previous, from homo sapiens. I call us homo techno. I think we have evolved into homo techno, which is like essentially a new species. Like if you look at the way, if you took an MRI of my brain and you took an MRI of like a medieval brain, I think it would be very different the way that it has evolved. Do you think when historians look back at this time, they'll see like this was a fundamental shift to what a human being is? I think, I do not think we are still homo sapiens. I believe we are homo techno. And I think we have evolved. And I think right now, the way we are evolving, we can choose how we do that. And I think we are being very reckless about how we're doing that. Like we're just having social media, but I think this idea that like this is a time to choose intelligent design should be taken very seriously. It like now is the moment to reprogram the human computer. It's like, if you go blind, your visual cortex will get taken over with other functions. We can choose our own evolution. We can change the way our brains work. And so we actually have a huge responsibility to do that. And I think I'm not sure who should be responsible for that, but there's definitely not adequate education. We're being inundated with all this technology that is fundamentally changing the physical structure of our brains. And we are not adequately responding to that to choose how we wanna evolve. And we could evolve, we could be really whatever we want. And I think this is a really important time. And I think if we choose correctly and we choose wisely, consciousness could exist for a very long time and integration with AI could be extremely positive. And I don't think enough people are focusing on this specific situation. Do you think we might irreversibly screw things up if we get things wrong now? Because the flip side of that, it seems humans are pretty adaptive. So maybe the way we figure things out is by screwing it up, like social media. Over a generation, we'll see the negative effects of social media, and then we build new social medias, and we just keep improving stuff. And then we learn from the failures of the past. Because humans seem to be really adaptive. On the flip side, we can get it wrong in a way where literally we create weapons of war or increase hate. Past a certain threshold, we really do a lot of damage. I mean, I think we're optimized to notice the negative things. But I would actually say one of the things that I think people aren't noticing is if you look at Silicon Valley and you look at the technocracy, like what's been happening there. When Silicon Valley started, it was all just Facebook and all this for profit crap that really wasn't particular. I guess it was useful, but it's sort of just whatever. But now you see lab grown meat, compostable, or biodegradable, single use cutlery, or meditation apps. I think we are actually evolving and changing, and technology is changing. I think there just maybe there isn't quite enough education about this. And also, I don't know if there's quite enough incentive for it because I think the way capitalism works, what we define as profit, we're also working on an old model of what we define as profit. I really think if we changed the idea of profit to include social good, you can have economic profit, social good also counting as profit would incentivize things that are more useful and more whatever spiritual technology or positive technology or things that help reprogram a human computer in a good way or things that help us intelligently design our new brains. Yeah, there's no reason why within the framework of capitalism, the word profit or the idea of profit can't also incorporate the well being of a human being. So like long term well being, long term happiness. Or even for example, we were talking about motherhood, like part of the reason I'm so late is because I had to get the baby to bed. And it's like, I keep thinking about motherhood, how under capitalism, it's like this extremely essential job that is very difficult that is not compensated. And we sort of like value things by how much we compensate them. And so we really devalue motherhood in our society and pretty much all societies. Like capitalism does not recognize motherhood. It's just a job that you're supposed to do for free. And it's like, but I feel like producing great humans should be seen as a great, as profit under capitalism. Like that should be, that's like a huge social good. Like every awesome human that gets made adds so much to the world. So like if that was integrated into the profit structure, then, you know, and if we potentially found a way to compensate motherhood. So come up with a compensation that's much broader than just money or. Or it could just be money. Like, what if you just made, I don't know, but I don't know how you'd pay for that. Like, I mean, that's where you start getting into. Reallocation of resources that people get upset over. Well, like what if we made like a motherhood Dow? Yeah, yeah. And, you know, used it to fund like single mothers, like, you know, pay for making babies. So, I mean, if you create and put beautiful things onto the world, that could be companies, that can be bridges, that could be art, that could be a lot of things, and that could be children, which are. Or education or. Anything, that should be valued by society, and that should be somehow incorporated into the framework of what, as a market, of what. Like, if you contribute children to this world, that should be valued and respected and sort of celebrated, like, proportional to what it is, which is, it's the thing that fuels human civilization. Yeah, like I. It's kind of important. I feel like everyone's always saying, I mean, I think we're in very different social spheres, but everyone's always saying, like, dismantle capitalism. And I'm like, well, okay, well, I don't think the government should own everything. Like, I don't think we should not have private ownership. Like, that's scary. You know, like that starts getting into weird stuff and just sort of like, I feel there's almost no way to do that without a police state, you know? But obviously, capitalism has some major flaws. And I think actually Mac showed me this idea called social capitalism, which is a form of capitalism that just like considers social good to be also profit. Like, you know, it's like, right now companies need to, like, you're supposed to grow every quarter or whatever to like show that you're functioning well, but it's like, okay, well, what if you kept the same amount of profit? You're still in the green, but then you have also all this social good. Like, do you really need all this extra economic growth or could you add this social good and that counts? And, you know, I don't know if, I am not an economist. I have no idea how this could be achieved, but. I don't think economists know how anything could be achieved either, but they pretend. It's the thing, they construct a model and they go on TV shows and sound like an expert. That's the definition of economist. How did being a mother, becoming a mother change you as a human being, would you say? Man, I think it kind of changed everything and it's still changing me a lot. It's actually changing me more right now in this moment than it was before. Like today, like this? Just like in the most recent months and stuff. Can you elucidate that, how change, like when you wake up in the morning and you look at yourself, it's again, which, who are you? How have you become different, would you say? I think it's just really reorienting my priorities. And at first I was really fighting against that because I somehow felt it was like a failure of feminism or something. Like I felt like it was like bad if like my kids started mattering more than my work. And then like more recently I started sort of analyzing that thought in myself and being like, that's also kind of a construct. It's like, we've just devalued motherhood so much in our culture that like, I feel guilty for caring about my kids more than I care about my work. So feminism includes breaking out of whatever the construct is. So just continually breaking, it's like freedom empower you to be free. And that means... But it also, but like being a mother, like I'm so much more creative. Like I cannot believe the massive amount of brain growth that I am. Why do you think that is? Just cause like the stakes are higher somehow? I think it's like, it's just so trippy watching consciousness emerge. It's just like, it's like going on a crazy journey or something. It's like the craziest science fiction novel you could ever read. It's just so crazy watching consciousness come into being. And then at the same time, like you're forced to value your time so much. Like when I have creative time now, it's so sacred. I need to like be really fricking on it. But the other thing is that I used to just be like a cynic and I used to just wanna... Like my last album was called Miss Anthropocene and it was like this like, it was like a study in villainy or like it was like, well, what if we have, instead of the old gods, we have like new gods and it's like Miss Anthropocene is like misanthrope like and Anthropocene, which is like the, you know, like and she's the goddess of climate change or whatever. And she's like destroying the world. And it was just like, it was like dark and it was like a study in villainy. And it was sort of just like, like I used to like have no problem just making cynical, angry, scary art. And not that there's anything wrong with that, but I think having kids just makes you such an optimist. It just inherently makes you wanna be an optimist so bad that like I feel more responsibility to make more optimistic things. And I get a lot of shit for it because everyone's like, oh, you're so privileged. Stop talking about like pie in the sky, stupid concepts and focus on like the now. But it's like, I think if we don't ideate about futures that could be good, we won't be able to get them. If everything is Blade Runner, then we're gonna end up with Blade Runner. It's like, as we said earlier, life imitates art. Like life really does imitate art. And so we really need more protopian or utopian art. I think this is incredibly essential for the future of humanity. And I think the current discourse where that's seen as a thinking about protopia or utopia is seen as a dismissal of the problems that we currently have. I think that is an incorrect mindset. And like having kids just makes me wanna imagine amazing futures that like maybe I won't be able to build, but they will be able to build if they want to. Yeah, it does seem like ideation is a precursor to creation. So you have to imagine it in order to be able to build it. And there is a sad thing about human nature that somehow a cynical view of the world is seen as a insightful view. You know, cynicism is often confused for insight, which is sad to see. And optimism is confused for naivete. Yes, yes. Like you don't, you're blinded by your, maybe your privilege or whatever. You're blinded by something, but you're certainly blinded. That's sad, that's sad to see because it seems like the optimists are the ones that create our future. They're the ones that build. In order to build the crazy thing, you have to be optimistic. You have to be either stupid or excited or passionate or mad enough to actually believe that it can be built. And those are the people that built it. My favorite quote of all time is from Star Wars, Episode 8, which I know everyone hates. Do you like Star Wars, Episode 8? No, yeah, probably I would say I would probably hate it, yeah. I don't have strong feelings about it. Let me backtrack. I don't have strong feelings about Star Wars. I'm a Tolkien person. I'm more into dragons and orcs and ogres. Yeah, I mean, Tolkien forever. I really want to have one more son and call him, I thought Tao Tecno Tolkien would be cool. It's a lot of T's, I like it. Yeah, and well, and Tao is six, two, eight, two pi. Yeah, Tao Tecno, yeah, yeah, yeah. And then techno is obviously the best genre of music, but also like technocracy. It just sounds really good. Yeah, that's right, and techno Tolkien, Tao Tecno Tolkien. That's a good, that's it. Tao Tecno Tolkien, but Star Wars, Episode 8, I know a lot of people have issues with it. Personally, on the record, I think it's the best Star Wars film. You're starting trouble today. Yeah, but don't kill what you hate, save what you love. Don't kill what you hate. Don't kill what you hate, save what you love. And I think we're, in society right now, we're in a diagnosis mode. We're just diagnosing and diagnosing and diagnosing, and we're trying to kill what we hate, and we're not trying to save what we love enough. And there's this Buckminster Fuller quote, which I'm gonna butcher, because I don't remember it correctly, but it's something along the lines of, don't try to destroy the old bad models, render them obsolete with better models. Maybe we don't need to destroy the oil industry. Maybe we just create a great new battery technology and sustainable transport, and just make it economically unreasonable to still continue to rely on fossil fuels. It's like, don't kill what you hate, save what you love. Make new things and just render the old things unusable. It's like if the college debt is so bad, and universities are so expensive, and I feel like education is becoming obsolete. I feel like we could completely revolutionize education, and we could make it free. And it's like, you look at JSTOR, and you have to pay to get all the studies and everything. What if we created a DAO that bought JSTOR, or we created a DAO that was funding studies, and those studies were open source, or free for everyone. And what if we just open sourced education and decentralized education and made it free, and all research was on the internet, and all the outcomes of studies were on the internet, and no one has student debt, and you just take tests when you apply for a job, and if you're qualified, then you can work there. This is just like, I don't know how anything works. I'm just randomly ranting, but. I like the humility. You gotta think from just basic first principles. What is the problem? What's broken? What are some ideas? That's it. And get excited about those ideas, and share your excitement, and don't tear each other down. It's just when you kill things, you often end up killing yourself. Like war is not a one sided, like you're not gonna go in and just kill them, like you're gonna get stabbed. It's like, and I think when I talk about this nexus point of that we're in this point in society where we're switching to intelligent design, I think part of our switch to intelligent design is that we need to choose nonviolence. And we need to, like, I think we can choose to start, I don't think we can eradicate violence from our species, because I think we need it a little bit, but I think we can choose to really reorient our primitive brains that are fighting over scarcity, and that are so attack oriented, and move into, we can optimize for creativity and building. Yeah, it's interesting to think how that happens, so some of it is just education, some of it is living life and introspecting your own mind, and trying to live up to the better angels of your nature for each one of us, all those kinds of things at scale. That's how we can sort of start to minimize the amount of destructive war in our world, and that's, to me, probably you're the same, technology is a really promising way to do that. Like, social media should be a really promising way to do that, it's a way we connect. I, you know, for the most part, I really enjoy social media. I just know all the negative stuff. I don't engage with any of the negative stuff. Just not even, like, by blocking or any of that kind of stuff, but just not letting it enter my mind. Like, just, like, when somebody says something negative, I see it, I immediately think positive thoughts about them, and I just forget they exist after that. Just move on, because, like, that negative energy, if I return the negative energy, they're going to get excited in a negative way right back, and it's just this kind of vicious cycle. But you would think technology would assist us in this process of letting go, of not taking things personally, of not engaging in the negativity, but unfortunately, social media profits from the negativity, so the current models. I mean, social media is like a gun. Like, you should take a course before you use it. Like, it's like, this is what I mean, like, when I say reprogram the human computer. Like, in school, you should learn about how social media optimizes to, you know, raise your cortisol levels and make you angry and crazy and stressed, and, like, you should learn how to have hygiene about how you use social media. But, so you can, yeah, choose not to focus on the negative stuff, but I don't know. I'm not sure social media should, I guess it should exist. I'm not sure. I mean, we're in the messy, it's the experimental phase. Like, we're working it out. Yeah, it's the early days. I don't even know, when you say social media, I don't know what that even means. We're in the very early days. I think social media is just basic human connection in the digital realm, and that, I think it should exist, but there's so many ways to do it in a bad way. There's so many ways to do it in a good way. There's all discussions of all the same human rights. We talk about freedom of speech. We talk about sort of violence in the space of digital media. We talk about hate speech. We talk about all these things that we had to figure out back in the day in the physical space. We're now figuring out in the digital space, and it's like baby stages. When the printing press came out, it was like pure chaos for a minute, you know? It's like when you inject, when there's a massive information injection into the general population, there's just gonna be, I feel like the printing press, I don't have the years, but it was like printing press came out, shit got really fucking bad for a minute, but then we got the enlightenment. And so it's like, I think we're in, this is like the second coming of the printing press. We're probably gonna have some shitty times for a minute, and then we're gonna have recalibrate to have a better understanding of how we consume media and how we deliver media. Speaking of programming the human computer, you mentioned Baby X. So there's this young consciousness coming to be, came from a cell. Like that whole thing doesn't even make sense. It came from DNA. Yeah. And then there's this baby computer that just like grows and grows and grows and grows, and now there's a conscious being with extremely impressive cognitive capabilities with, Have you met him? Yes, yeah. Yeah. He's actually really smart. He's really smart. Yeah. He's weird. Yeah. Or a baby. He does. I don't, I haven't. I don't know a lot of other babies, but he seems to be smart. Zach, I don't hang out with babies often, but this baby was very impressive. He does a lot of pranks and stuff. Oh, so he's like. Like he'll like give you a treat and then take it away and laugh and like stuff like that. So he's like a chess player. So here's a cognitive sort of, there's a computer being programmed. So he's taking in the environment, interacting with a specific set of humans. How would you, first of all, what is it? What, let me ask. I want to ask how do you program this computer? And also how do you make sense of that there's a conscious being right there that wasn't there before? It's giving me a lot of crisis thoughts. I'm thinking really hard. I think that's part of the reason it's like, I'm struggling to focus on art and stuff right now. Cause baby X is becoming conscious and like my it's just reorienting my brain. Like my brain is suddenly totally shifting of like, oh shit, like the way we raise children. Like, I hate all the baby books and everything. I hate them. Like they're, oh, the art is so bad. And like all this stuff, everything about all the aesthetics. And like, I'm just like, ah, like this is so. The programming languages we're using to program these baby computers isn't good. Yeah, like I'm thinking, and I, not that I have like good answers or know what to do, but I'm just thinking really, really hard about it. I, we recently watched Totoro with him, Studio Ghibli. And it's just like a fantastic film. And he like responded to, I know you're not supposed to show baby screens too much, but like, I think it's the most sort of like, I feel like it's the highest art baby content. Like it really speaks, there's almost no talking in it. It's really simple. Although all the dialogue is super, super, super simple, you know, and it's like a one to three year old can like really connect with it. Like it feels like it's almost aimed at like a one to three year old, but it's like great art and it's so imaginative and it's so beautiful. And like the first time I showed it to him, he was just like so invested in it, unlike I've ever, unlike anything else I'd ever shown him. Like he was just like crying when they cry and laughing when they laugh, like just like having this roller coaster of like emotions, like, and he learned a bunch of words. Like he was, and he started saying Totoro and started just saying all this stuff after watching Totoro, and he wants to watch it all the time. And I was like, man, why isn't there an industry of this? Like why aren't our best artists focusing on making art like for the birth of consciousness? Like, and that's one of the things I've been thinking I really wanna start doing. You know, I don't wanna speak before I do things too much, but like, I'm just like ages one to three, like we should be putting so much effort into that. And the other thing about Totoro is it's like, it's like better for the environment because adults love Totoro. It's such good art that everyone loves it. Like I still have all my old Totoro merch from when I was a kid. Like I literally have the most ragged old Totoro merch. Like everybody loves it, everybody keeps it. It's like, why does the art we have for babies need to suck and be not accessible to adults and then just be thrown out when, you know, they age out of it? Like, it's like, I don't know. I don't have like a fully formed thought here, but this is just something I've been thinking about a lot is like, how do we like, how do we have more Totoroesque content? Like how do we have more content like this that like is universal and everybody loves, but is like really geared to an emerging consciousness? Emerging consciousness in the first like three years of life that so much turmoil, so much evolution of mind is happening. It seems like a crucial time. Would you say to make it not suck, do you think of basically treating a child like they have the capacity to have the brilliance of an adult or even beyond that? Is that how you think of that mind or? No, cause they still, they like it when you talk weird and stuff. Like they respond better to, cause even they can imitate better when your voice is higher. Like people say like, oh, don't do baby talk. But it's like, when your voice is higher, it's closer to something they can imitate. So they like, like the baby talk actually kind of works. Like it helps them learn to communicate. I've found it to be more effective with learning words and stuff. But like, you're not speaking down to them. Like do they have the capacity\",\n          \"The following is a conversation with Sean Carroll. He's a theoretical physicist at Caltech specializing in quantum mechanics, gravity, and cosmology. He's the author of several popular books, one on the arrow of time called From Eternity to Here, one on the Higgs boson called Particle at the End of the Universe, and one on science and philosophy called The Big Picture on the Origins of Life, Meaning, and the Universe Itself. He has an upcoming book on quantum mechanics that you can preorder now called Something Deeply Hidden. He writes one of my favorite blogs on his website, preposterousuniverse.com. I recommend clicking on the Greatest Hits link that lists accessible, interesting posts on the arrow of time, dark matter, dark energy, the Big Bang, general relativity, string theory, quantum mechanics, and the big meta questions about the philosophy of science, God, ethics, politics, academia, and much, much more. Finally, and perhaps most famously, he's the host of a podcast called Mindscape that you should subscribe to and support on Patreon. Along with the Joe Rogan experience, Sam Harris's Making Sense, and Dan Carlin's Hardcore History, Sean's Mindscape podcast is one of my favorite ways to learn new ideas or explore different perspectives and ideas that I thought I understood. It was truly an honor to meet and spend a couple hours with Sean. It's a bit heartbreaking to say that for the first time ever, the audio recorder for this podcast died in the middle of our conversation. There's technical reasons for this, having to do with phantom power that I now understand and will avoid. It took me one hour to notice and fix the problem. So, much like the universe is 68% dark energy, roughly the same amount from this conversation was lost, except in the memories of the two people involved and in my notes. I'm sure we'll talk again and continue this conversation on this podcast or on Sean's. And of course, I look forward to it. This is the Artificial Intelligence podcast. If you enjoy it, subscribe on YouTube, iTunes, support it on Patreon, or simply connect with me on Twitter at Lex Friedman. And now, here's my conversation with Sean Carroll. What do you think is more interesting and impactful, understanding how the universe works at a fundamental level or understanding how the human mind works? You know, of course this is a crazy, meaningless, unanswerable question in some sense, because they're both very interesting and there's no absolute scale of interestingness that we can rate them on. There's a glib answer that says the human brain is part of the universe, right? And therefore, understanding the universe is more fundamental than understanding the human brain. But do you really believe that once we understand the fundamental way the universe works at the particle level, the forces, we would be able to understand how the mind works? No, certainly not. We cannot understand how ice cream works just from understanding how particles work, right? So I'm a big believer in emergence. I'm a big believer that there are different ways of talking about the world beyond just the most fundamental microscopic one. You know, when we talk about tables and chairs and planets and people, we're not talking the language of particle physics and cosmology. So, but understanding the universe, you didn't say just at the most fundamental level, right? So understanding the universe at all levels is part of that. I do think, you know, to be a little bit more fair to the question, there probably are general principles of complexity, biology, information processing, memory, knowledge, creativity that go beyond just the human brain, right? And maybe one could count understanding those as part of understanding the universe. The human brain, as far as we know, is the most complex thing in the universe. So there's, it's certainly absurd to think that by understanding the fundamental laws of particle physics, you get any direct insight on how the brain works. But then there's this step from the fundamentals of particle physics to information processing, which a lot of physicists and philosophers may be a little bit carelessly take when they talk about artificial intelligence. Do you think of the universe as a kind of a computational device? No, to be like, the honest answer there is no. There's a sense in which the universe processes information, clearly. There's a sense in which the universe is like a computer, clearly. But in some sense, I think, I tried to say this once on my blog and no one agreed with me, but the universe is more like a computation than a computer because the universe happens once. A computer is a general purpose machine, right? That you can ask it different questions, even a pocket calculator, right? And it's set up to answer certain kinds of questions. The universe isn't that. So information processing happens in the universe, but it's not what the universe is. And I know your MIT colleague, Seth Lloyd, feels very differently about this, right? Well, you're thinking of the universe as a closed system. I am. So what makes a computer more like a PC, like a computing machine is that there's a human that every once comes up to it and moves the mouse around. So input. Gives it input. Gives it input. And that's why you're saying it's just a computation, a deterministic thing that's just unrolling. But the immense complexity of it is nevertheless like processing. There's a state and then it changes with good rules. And there's a sense for a lot of people that if the brain operates, the human brain operates within that world, then it's simply just a small subset of that. And so there's no reason we can't build arbitrarily great intelligences. Yeah. Do you think of intelligence in this way? Intelligence is tricky. I don't have a definition of it offhand. So I remember this panel discussion that I saw on YouTube. I wasn't there, but Seth Lloyd was on the panel. And so was Martin Rees, the famous astrophysicist. And Seth gave his shtick for why the universe is a computer and explained this. And Martin Rees said, so what is not a computer? And Seth was like, oh, that's a good question. I'm not sure. Because if you have a sufficiently broad definition of what a computer is, then everything is, right? And the simile or the analogy gains force when it excludes some things. You know, is the moon going around the earth performing a computation? I can come up with definitions in which the answer is yes, but it's not a very useful computation. I think that it's absolutely helpful to think about the universe in certain situations, certain contexts, as an information processing device. I'm even guilty of writing a paper called Quantum Circuit Cosmology, where we modeled the whole universe as a quantum circuit. As a circuit. As a circuit, yeah. With qubits kind of thing? With qubits basically, right, yeah. So, and qubits becoming more and more entangled. So do we wanna digress a little bit? Let's do it. It's kind of fun. So here's a mystery about the universe that is so deep and profound that nobody talks about it. Space expands, right? And we talk about, in a certain region of space, a certain number of degrees of freedom, a certain number of ways that the quantum fields and the particles in that region can arrange themselves. That number of degrees of freedom in a region of space is arguably finite. We actually don't know how many there are, but there's a very good argument that says it's a finite number. So as the universe expands and space gets bigger, are there more degrees of freedom? If it's an infinite number, it doesn't really matter. Infinity times two is still infinity. But if it's a finite number, then there's more space, so there's more degrees of freedom. So where did they come from? That would mean the universe is not a closed system. There's more degrees of freedom popping into existence. So what we suggested was that there are more degrees of freedom, and it's not that they're not there to start, but they're not entangled to start. So the universe that you and I know of, the three dimensions around us that we see, we said those are the entangled degrees of freedom making up space time. And as the universe expands, there are a whole bunch of qubits in their zero state that become entangled with the rest of space time through the action of these quantum circuits. So what does it mean that there's now more degrees of freedom as they become more entangled? Yeah, so. As the universe expands. That's right, so there's more and more degrees of freedom that are entangled, that are playing part, playing the role of part of the entangled space time structure. So the basic, the underlying philosophy is that space time itself arises from the entanglement of some fundamental quantum degrees of freedom. Wow, okay, so at which point is most of the entanglement happening? Are we talking about close to the Big Bang? Are we talking about throughout the time of the life? Throughout history, yeah. So the idea is that at the Big Bang, almost all the degrees of freedom that the universe could have were there, but they were unentangled with anything else. And that's a reflection of the fact that the Big Bang had a low entropy. It was a very simple, very small place. And as space expands, more and more degrees of freedom become entangled with the rest of the world. Well, I have to ask John Carroll, what do you think of the thought experiment from Nick Bostrom that we're living in a simulation? So I think, let me contextualize that a little bit more. I think people don't actually take this thought experiments. I think it's quite interesting. It's not very useful, but it's quite interesting. From the perspective of AI, a lot of the learning that can be done usually happens in simulation from artificial examples. And so it's a constructive question to ask, how difficult is our real world to simulate? Right. Which is kind of a dual part of, if we're living in a simulation and somebody built that simulation, if you were to try to do it yourself, how hard would it be? So obviously we could be living in a simulation. If you just want the physical possibility, then I completely agree that it's physically possible. I don't think that we actually are. So take this one piece of data into consideration. You know, we live in a big universe, okay? There's two trillion galaxies in our observable universe with 200 billion stars in each galaxy, et cetera. It would seem to be a waste of resources to have a universe that big going on just to do a simulation. So in other words, I want to be a good Bayesian. I want to ask under this hypothesis, what do I expect to see? So the first thing I would say is I wouldn't expect to see a universe that was that big, okay? The second thing is I wouldn't expect the resolution of the universe to be as good as it is. So it's always possible that if our superhuman simulators only have finite resources, that they don't render the entire universe, right? That the part that is out there, the two trillion galaxies, isn't actually being simulated fully, okay? But then the obvious extrapolation of that is that only I am being simulated fully. Like the rest of you are just non player characters, right? I'm the only thing that is real. The rest of you are just chat bots. Beyond this wall, I see the wall, but there is literally nothing on the other side of the wall. That is sort of the Bayesian prediction. That's what it would be like to do an efficient simulation of me. So like none of that seems quite realistic. I don't see, I hear the argument that it's just possible and easy to simulate lots of things. I don't see any evidence from what we know about our universe that we look like a simulated universe. Now, maybe you can say, well, we don't know what it would look like, but that's just abandoning your Bayesian responsibilities. Like your job is to say under this theory, here's what you would expect to see. Yeah, so certainly if you think about simulation as a thing that's like a video game where only a small subset is being rendered. But say the entire, all the laws of physics, the entire closed system of the quote unquote universe, it had a creator. Yeah, it's always possible. Right, so that's not useful to think about when you're thinking about physics. The way Nick Bostrom phrases it, if it's possible to simulate a universe, eventually we'll do it. Right. You can use that by the way for a lot of things. Well, yeah. But I guess the question is, how hard is it to create a universe? I wrote a little blog post about this and maybe I'm missing something, but there's an argument that says not only that it might be possible to simulate a universe, but probably if you imagine that you actually attribute consciousness and agency to the little things that we're simulating, to our little artificial beings, there's probably a lot more of them than there are ordinary organic beings in the universe or there will be in the future, right? So there's an argument that not only is being a simulation possible, it's probable because in the space of all living consciousnesses, most of them are being simulated, right? Most of them are not at the top level. I think that argument must be wrong because it follows from that argument that, if we're simulated, but we can also simulate other things, well, but if we can simulate other things, they can simulate other things, right? If we give them enough power and resolution and ultimately we'll reach a bottom because the laws of physics in our universe have a bottom, we're made of atoms and so forth, so there will be the cheapest possible simulations. And if you believe the original argument, you should conclude that we should be in the cheapest possible simulation because that's where most people are. But we don't look like that. It doesn't look at all like we're at the edge of resolution, that we're 16 bit things. It seems much easier to make much lower level things than we are. And also, I questioned the whole approach to the anthropic principle that says we are typical observers in the universe. I think that that's not actually, I think that there's a lot of selection that we can do that we're typical within things we already know, but not typical within all of the universe. So do you think there's intelligent life, however you would like to define intelligent life, out there in the universe? My guess is that there is not intelligent life in the observable universe other than us, simply on the basis of the fact that the likely number of other intelligent species in the observable universe, there's two likely numbers, zero or billions. And if there had been billions, you would have noticed already. For there to be literally like a small number, like, you know, Star Trek, there's a dozen intelligent civilizations in our galaxy, but not a billion, that's weird. That's sort of bizarre to me. It's easy for me to imagine that there are zero others because there's just a big bottleneck to making multicellular life or technological life or whatever. It's very hard for me to imagine that there's a whole bunch out there that have somehow remained hidden from us. The question I'd like to ask is what would intelligent life look like? What I mean by that question and where it's going is what if intelligent life is just in some very big ways different than the one that has on Earth? That there's all kinds of intelligent life that operates at different scales of both size and temporal. Right, that's a great possibility because I think we should be humble about what intelligence is, what life is. We don't even agree on what life is, much less what intelligent life is, right? So that's an argument for humility, saying there could be intelligent life of a very different character, right? Like you could imagine the dolphins are intelligent but never invent space travel because they live in the ocean and they don't have thumbs, right? So they never invent technology, they never invent smelting. Maybe the universe is full of intelligent species that just don't make technology, right? That's compatible with the data, I think. And I think maybe what you're pointing at is even more out there versions of intelligence, intelligence in intermolecular clouds or on the surface of a neutron star or in between the galaxies in giant things where the equivalent of a heartbeat is 100 million years. On the one hand, yes, we should be very open minded about those things. On the other hand, all of us share the same laws of physics. There might be something about the laws of physics, even though we don't currently know exactly what that thing would be, that makes meters and years the right length and timescales for intelligent life. Maybe not, but we're made of atoms, atoms have a certain size, we orbit stars or stars have a certain lifetime. It's not impossible to me that there's a sweet spot for intelligent life that we find ourselves in. So I'm open minded either way, I'm open minded either being humble and there's all sorts of different kinds of life or no, there's a reason we just don't know it yet why life like ours is the kind of life that's out there. Yeah, I'm of two minds too, but I often wonder if our brains is just designed to quite obviously to operate and see the world in these timescales and we're almost blind and the tools we've created for detecting things are blind to the kind of observation needed to see intelligent life at other scales. Well, I'm totally open to that, but so here's another argument I would make, we have looked for intelligent life, but we've looked at for it in the dumbest way we can, by turning radio telescopes to the sky. And why in the world would a super advanced civilization randomly beam out radio signals wastefully in all directions into the universe? That just doesn't make any sense, especially because in order to think that you would actually contact another civilization, you would have to do it forever, you have to keep doing it for millions of years, that sounds like a waste of resources. If you thought that there were other solar systems with planets around them, where maybe intelligent life didn't yet exist, but might someday, you wouldn't try to talk to it with radio waves, you would send a spacecraft out there and you would park it around there and it would be like, from our point of view, it'd be like 2001, where there was a monolith. Monolith. There could be an artifact, in fact, the other way works also, right? There could be artifacts in our solar system that have been put there by other technologically advanced civilizations and that's how we will eventually contact them. We just haven't explored the solar system well enough yet to find them. The reason why we don't think about that is because we're young and impatient, right? Like, it would take more than my lifetime to actually send something to another star system and wait for it and then come back. So, but if we start thinking on hundreds of thousands of years or million year time scales, that's clearly the right thing to do. Are you excited by the thing that Elon Musk is doing with SpaceX in general? Space, but the idea of space exploration, even though your, or your species is young and impatient? Yeah. No, I do think that space travel is crucially important, long term. Even to other star systems. And I think that many people overestimate the difficulty because they say, look, if you travel 1% the speed of light to another star system, we'll be dead before we get there, right? And I think that it's much easier. And therefore, when they write their science fiction stories, they imagine we'd go faster than the speed of light because otherwise they're too impatient, right? We're not gonna go faster than the speed of light, but we could easily imagine that the human lifespan gets extended to thousands of years. And once you do that, then the stars are much closer effectively, right? And then what's a hundred year trip, right? So I think that that's gonna be the future, the far future, not my lifetime once again, but baby steps. Unless your lifetime gets extended. Well, it's in a race against time, right? A friend of mine who actually thinks about these things said, you know, you and I are gonna die, but I don't know about our grandchildren. That's, I don't know, predicting the future is hard, but that's at least a plausible scenario. And so, yeah, no, I think that as we discussed earlier, there are threats to the earth, known and unknown, right? Having spread humanity and biology elsewhere is a really important longterm goal. What kind of questions can science not currently answer, but might soon? When you think about the problems and the mysteries before us that may be within reach of science. I think an obvious one is the origin of life. We don't know how that happened. There's a difficulty in knowing how it happened historically actually, you know, literally on earth, but starting life from non life is something I kind of think we're close to, right? We're really. You really think so? Like how difficult is it to start life? Well, I've talked to people, including on the podcast about this. You know, life requires three things. Life as we know it. So there's a difference with life, which who knows what it is, and life as we know it, which we can talk about with some intelligence. So life as we know it requires compartmentalization. You need like a little membrane around your cell. Metabolism, you need to take in food and eat it and let that make you do things. And then replication, okay? So you need to have some information about who you are that you pass down to future generations. In the lab, compartmentalization seems pretty easy. Not hard to make lipid bilayers that come into little cellular walls pretty easily. Metabolism and replication are hard, but replication we're close to. People have made RNA like molecules in the lab that I think the state of the art is, they're not able to make one molecule that reproduces itself, but they're able to make two molecules that reproduce each other. So that's okay. That's pretty close. Metabolism is harder, believe it or not, even though it's sort of the most obvious thing, but you want some sort of controlled metabolism and the actual cellular machinery in our bodies is quite complicated. It's hard to see it just popping into existence all by itself. It probably took a while, but we're making progress. And in fact, I don't think we're spending nearly enough money on it. If I were the NSF, I would flood this area with money because it would change our view of the world if we could actually make life in the lab and understand how it was made originally here on earth. And I'm sure it'd have some ripple effects that help cure disease and so on. I mean, just that understanding. So synthetic biology is a wonderful big frontier where we're making cells. Right now, the best way to do that is to borrow heavily from existing biology, right? Well, Craig Venter several years ago created an artificial cell, but all he did was, not all he did, it was a tremendous accomplishment, but all he did was take out the DNA from a cell and put in entirely new DNA and let it boot up and go. What about the leap to creating intelligent life on earth? Yeah. Again, we define intelligence, of course, but let's just even say Homo sapiens, the modern intelligence in our human brain. Do you have a sense of what's involved in that leap and how big of a leap that is? So AI would count in this, or do you really want life? Do you want really an organism in some sense? AI would count, I think. Okay. Yeah, of course, of course AI would count. Well, let's say artificial consciousness, right? So I do not think we are on the threshold of creating artificial consciousness. I think it's possible. I'm not, again, very educated about how close we are, but my impression is not that we're really close because we understand how little we understand of consciousness and what it is. So if we don't have any idea what it is, it's hard to imagine we're on the threshold of making it ourselves. But it's doable, it's possible. I don't see any obstacles in principle. So yeah, I would hold out some interest in that happening eventually. I think in general, consciousness, I think we would be just surprised how easy consciousness is once we create intelligence. I think consciousness is a thing that's just something we all fake. Well, good. No, actually, I like this idea that in fact, consciousness is way less mysterious than we think because we're all at every time, at every moment, less conscious than we think we are, right? We can fool things. And I think that plus the idea that you not only have artificial intelligent systems, but you put them in a body, right, give them a robot body, that will help the faking a lot. Yeah, I think creating consciousness in artificial consciousness is as simple as asking a Roomba to say, I'm conscious, and refusing to be talked out of it. Could be, it could be. And I mean, I'm almost being silly, but that's what we do. That's what we do with each other. This is the kind of, that consciousness is also a social construct. And a lot of our ideas of intelligence is a social construct. And so reaching that bar involves something that's beyond, that doesn't necessarily involve the fundamental understanding of how you go from electrons to neurons to cognition. No, actually, I think that is an extremely good point. And in fact, what it suggests is, so yeah, you referred to Kate Darling, who I had on the podcast, and who does these experiments with very simple robots, but they look like animals, and they can look like they're experiencing pain, and we human beings react very negatively to these little robots looking like they're experiencing pain. And what you wanna say is, yeah, but they're just robots. It's not really pain, right? It's just some electrons going around. But then you realize, you and I are just electrons going around, and that's what pain is also. And so what I would have an easy time imagining is that there is a spectrum between these simple little robots that Kate works with and a human being, where there are things that sort of by some strict definition, Turing test level thing are not conscious, but nevertheless walk and talk like they're conscious. And it could be that the future is, I mean, Siri is close, right? And so it might be the future has a lot more agents like that. And in fact, rather than someday going, aha, we have consciousness, we'll just creep up on it with more and more accurate reflections of what we expect. And in the future, maybe the present, for example, we haven't met before, and you're basically assuming that I'm human as it's a high probability at this time because the yeah, but in the future, there might be question marks around that, right? Yeah, no, absolutely. Certainly videos are almost to the point where you shouldn't trust them already. Photos you can't trust, right? Videos is easier to trust, but we're getting worse that, we're getting better at faking them, right? Yeah, so physical embodied people, what's so hard about faking that? So this is very depressing, this conversation we're having right now. So I mean, To me, it's exciting. To me, you're doing it. So it's exciting to you, but it's a sobering thought. We're very bad, right? At imagining what the next 50 years are gonna be like when we're in the middle of a phase transition as we are right now. Yeah, and I, in general, I'm not blind to all the threats. I am excited by the power of technology to solve, to protect us against the threats as they evolve. I'm not as much as Steven Pinker optimistic about the world, but in everything I've seen, all of the brilliant people in the world that I've met are good people. So the army of the good in terms of the development of technology is large. Okay, you're way more optimistic than I am. I think that goodness and badness are equally distributed among intelligent and unintelligent people. I don't see much of a correlation there. Interesting. Neither of us have proof. Yeah, exactly. Again, opinions are free, right? Nor definitions of good and evil. We come without definitions or without data opinions. So what kind of questions can science not currently answer and may never be able to answer in your view? Well, the obvious one is what is good and bad? What is right and wrong? I think that there are questions that, science tells us what happens, what the world is and what it does. It doesn't say what the world should do or what we should do, because we're part of the world. But we are part of the world and we have the ability to feel like something's right, something's wrong. And to make a very long story very short, I think that the idea of moral philosophy is systematizing our intuitions of what is right and what is wrong. And science might be able to predict ahead of time what we will do, but it won't ever be able to judge whether we should have done it or not. So, you're kind of unique in terms of scientists. Listen, it doesn't have to do with podcasts, but even just reaching out, I think you referred to as sort of doing interdisciplinary science. So you reach out and talk to people that are outside of your discipline, which I always hope that's what science was for. In fact, I was a little disillusioned when I realized that academia is very siloed. Yeah. And so the question is, how, at your own level, how do you prepare for these conversations? How do you think about these conversations? How do you open your mind enough to have these conversations? And it may be a little bit broader, how can you advise other scientists to have these kinds of conversations? Not at the podcast, the fact that you're doing a podcast is awesome, other people get to hear them, but it's also good to have it without mics in general. It's a good question, but a tough one to answer. I think about a guy I know who's a personal trainer, and he was asked on a podcast, how do we psych ourselves up to do a workout? How do we make that discipline to go and work out? And he's like, why are you asking me? I can't stop working out. I don't need to psych myself up. So, and likewise, he asked me, how do you get to have interdisciplinary conversations on all sorts of different things, all sorts of different people? I'm like, that's what makes me go, right? Like that's, I couldn't stop doing that. I did that long before any of them were recorded. In fact, a lot of the motivation for starting recording it was making sure I would read all these books that I had purchased, right? Like all these books I wanted to read, not enough time to read them. And now if I have the motivation, cause I'm gonna interview Pat Churchland, I'm gonna finally read her book. You know, and it's absolutely true that academia is extraordinarily siloed, right? We don't talk to people. We rarely do. And in fact, when we do, it's punished. You know, like the people who do it successfully generally first became very successful within their little siloed discipline. And only then did they start expanding out. If you're a young person, you know, I have graduate students. I try to be very, very candid with them about this, that it's, you know, most graduate students are to not become faculty members, right? It's a tough road. And so live the life you wanna live, but do it with your eyes open about what it does to your job chances. And the more broad you are and the less time you spend hyper specializing in your field, the lower your job chances are. That's just an academic reality. It's terrible, I don't like it, but it's a reality. And for some people, that's fine. Like there's plenty of people who are wonderful scientists who have zero interest in branching out and talking to things, to anyone outside their field. But it is disillusioning to me. Some of the, you know, romantic notion I had of the intellectual academic life is belied by the reality of it. The idea that we should reach out beyond our discipline and that is a positive good is just so rare in universities that it may as well not exist at all. But that said, even though you're saying you're doing it like the personal trainer, because you just can't help it, you're also an inspiration to others. Like I could speak for myself. You know, I also have a career I'm thinking about, right? And without your podcast, I may have not have been doing this at all, right? So it makes me realize that these kinds of conversations is kind of what science is about in many ways. The reason we write papers, this exchange of ideas, is it's much harder to do interdisciplinary papers, I would say. And conversations are easier. So conversations is the beginning. And in the field of AI, it's obvious that we should think outside of pure computer vision competitions on a particular data sets. We should think about the broader impact of how this can be, you know, reaching out to physics, to psychology, to neuroscience and having these conversations so that you're an inspiration. And so never know how the world changes. I mean, the fact that this stuff is out there and I've a huge number of people come up to me, grad students, really loving the podcast, inspired by it. And they will probably have that, they'll be ripple effects when they become faculty and so on and so on. We can end on a balance between pessimism and optimism. And Sean, thank you so much for talking to me, it was awesome. No, Lex, thank you very much for this conversation.

Jordan, a professor at Berkeley and one of the most influential people in the history of machine learning, statistics, and artificial intelligence. He has been cited over 170,000 times and he has mentored many of the world class researchers defining the field of AI today, including Andrew Ng, Zubin Garamani, Ben Taskar, and Yoshua Bengio. All this, to me, is as impressive as the over 32,000 points in the six NBA championships of the Michael J. Jordan of basketball fame. There's a nonzero probability that I talked to the other Michael Jordan given my connection to and love of the Chicago Bulls of the 90s, but if I had to pick one, I'm going with the Michael Jordan of statistics and computer science, or as Yann LeCun calls him, the Miles Davis of machine learning. In his blog post titled Artificial Intelligence, the Revolution Hasn't Happened Yet, Michael argues for broadening the scope of the artificial intelligence field. In many ways, the underlying spirit of this podcast is the same, to see artificial intelligence as a deeply human endeavor, to not only engineer algorithms and robots, but to understand and empower human beings at all levels of abstraction, from the individual to our civilization as a whole. This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast.

Cash App lets you send money to friends, buy Bitcoin, and invest in the stock market with as little as $1. Since Cash App does fractional share trading, let me mention that the order execution algorithm that worked behind the scenes to create the abstraction of the fractional orders is to me an algorithmic marvel. Great props for the Cash App engineers for solving a hard problem that in the end provides an easy interface that takes a step up to the next layer of abstraction over the stock market, making trading more accessible for new investors and diversification much easier. So once again, if you get Cash App from the App Store or Google Play and use the code LEX PODCAST, you'll get $10 and Cash App will also donate $10 to First, one of my favorite organizations that is helping to advance robotics and STEM education for young people around the world. And now, here's my conversation with Michael I. Jordan. Given that you're one of the greats in the field of AI, machine learning, computer science, and so on, you're trivially called the Michael Jordan of machine learning, although as you know, you were born first, so technically MJ is the Michael I. Jordan of basketball. But anyway, my favorite is Yann LeCun calling you the Miles Davis of machine learning because as he says, you reinvent yourself periodically and sometimes leave fans scratching their heads after you change direction. So can you put at first your historian hat on and give a history of computer science and AI as you saw it, as you experienced it, including the four generations of AI successes that I've seen you talk about? Sure. Yeah, first of all, I much prefer Yann's metaphor. Miles Davis was a real explorer in jazz and he had a coherent story. So I think I have one, but it's not just the one you lived, it's the one you think about later. What the historian does is they look back and they revisit. I think what's happening right now is not AI, that was an intellectual aspiration that's still alive today as an aspiration. But I think this is akin to the development of chemical engineering from chemistry or electrical engineering from electromagnetism. So if you go back to the 30s or 40s, there wasn't yet chemical engineering. There was chemistry, there was fluid flow, there was mechanics and so on. But people pretty clearly viewed interesting goals to try to build factories that make chemicals products and do it viably, safely, make good ones, do it at scale. So people started to try to do that, of course, and some factories worked, some didn't, some were not viable, some exploded, but in parallel, developed a whole field called chemical engineering. Electrical engineering is a field, it's no bones about it, it has theoretical aspects to it, it has practical aspects. It's not just engineering, quote unquote, it's the real thing, real concepts are needed. Same thing with electrical engineering. There was Maxwell's equations, which in some sense were everything you know about electromagnetism, but you needed to figure out how to build circuits, how to build modules, how to put them together, how to bring electricity from one point to another safely and so on and so forth. So a whole field that developed called electrical engineering. I think that's what's happening right now, is that we have a proto field, which is statistics, more of the theoretical side of it, algorithmic side of computer science, that was enough to start to build things, but what things? Systems that bring value to human beings and use human data and mix in human decisions. The engineering side of that is all ad hoc. That's what's emerging. In fact, if you wanna call machine learning a field, I think that's what it is, that it's a proto form of engineering based on statistical and computational ideas of previous generations. But do you think there's something deeper about AI in his dreams and aspirations as compared to chemical engineering and electrical engineering? Well the dreams and aspirations maybe, but those are 500 years from now. I think that that's like the Greeks sitting there and saying, it would be neat to get to the moon someday. I think we have no clue how the brain does computation. We're just a clueless. We're even worse than the Greeks on most anything interesting scientifically of our era. Can you linger on that just for a moment because you stand not completely unique, but a little bit unique in the clarity of that. Can you elaborate your intuition of why we're, like where we stand in our understanding of the human brain? And a lot of people say, you know, scientists say we're not very far in understanding human brain, but you're like, you're saying we're in the dark here. Well, I know I'm not unique. I don't even think in the clarity, but if you talk to real neuroscientists that really study real synapses or real neurons, they agree, they agree. It's a hundreds of year task and they're building it up slowly and surely. What the signal is there is not clear. We think we have all of our metaphors. We think it's electrical, maybe it's chemical, it's a whole soup, it's ions and proteins and it's a cell. And that's even around like a single synapse. If you look at a electron micrograph of a single synapse, it's a city of its own. And that's one little thing on a dendritic tree, which is extremely complicated electrochemical thing. And it's doing these spikes and voltages are flying around and then proteins are taking that and taking it down into the DNA and who knows what. So it is the problem of the next few centuries. It is fantastic. But we have our metaphors about it. Is it an economic device? Is it like the immune system or is it like a layered set of, you know, arithmetic computations? We have all these metaphors and they're fun. But that's not real science per se. There is neuroscience. That's not neuroscience. All right. That's like the Greek speculating about how to get to the moon, fun, right? And I think that I like to say this fairly strongly because I think a lot of young people think we're on the verge because a lot of people who don't talk about it clearly let it be understood that, yes, we kind of, this is a brain inspired, we're kind of close, you know, breakthroughs are on the horizon. And that's scrupulous people sometimes who need money for their labs. That's what I'm saying, scrupulous, but people will oversell, I need money for my lab, I'm studying computational neuroscience, I'm going to oversell it. And so there's been too much of that. So I'll step into the gray area between metaphor and engineering with, I'm not sure if you're familiar with brain computer interfaces. So a company like Elon Musk has Neuralink that's working on putting electrodes into the brain and trying to be able to read, both read and send electrical signals. Just as you said, even the basic mechanism of communication in the brain is not something we understand. But do you hope without understanding the fundamental principles of how the brain works, we'll be able to do something interesting at that gray area of metaphor? It's not my area. So I hope in the sense, like anybody else hopes for some interesting things to happen from research, I would expect more something like Alzheimer's will get figured out from modern neuroscience. There's a lot of human suffering based on brain disease and we throw things like lithium at the brain, it kind of works, no one has a clue why. That's not quite true, but mostly we don't know. And that's even just about the biochemistry of the brain and how it leads to mood swings and so on. How thought emerges from that, we were really, really completely dim. So that you might want to hook up electrodes and try to do some signal processing on that and try to find patterns, fine, by all means, go for it. It's just not scientific at this point. So it's like kind of sitting in a satellite and watching the emissions from a city and trying to infer things about the microeconomy, even though you don't have microeconomic concepts. It's really that kind of thing. And so yes, can you find some signals that do something interesting or useful? Can you control a cursor or mouse with your brain? Yeah, absolutely, and then I can imagine business models based on that and even medical applications of that. But from there to understanding algorithms that allow us to really tie in deeply from the brain to computer, I just, no, I don't agree with Elon Musk. I don't think that's even, that's not for our generations, not even for the century. So just in hopes of getting you to dream, you've mentioned Kolmogorov and Turing might pop up, do you think that there might be breakthroughs that will get you to sit back in five, 10 years and say, wow? Oh, I'm sure there will be, but I don't think that there'll be demos that impress me. I don't think that having a computer call a restaurant and pretend to be a human is a breakthrough. Right. And people, you know, some people present it as such. It's imitating human intelligence. It's even putting coughs in the thing to make a bit of a PR stunt. And so fine that the world runs on those things too. And I don't want to diminish all the hard work and engineering that goes behind things like that and the ultimate value to the human race. But that's not scientific understanding. And I know the people that work on these things, they are after scientific understanding. In the meantime, they've got to kind of, you know, the trains got to run and they got mouths to feed and they got things to do and there's nothing wrong with all that. I would call that though, just engineering. And I want to distinguish that between an engineering field, like electrical engineering and chemical engineering that originally emerged, that had real principles and you really know what you're doing and you had a little scientific understanding, maybe not even complete. So it became more predictable and it really gave value to human life because it was understood. And so we don't want to muddle too much these waters of, you know, what we're able to do versus what we really can't do in a way that's going to impress the next. So I don't need to be wowed, but I think that someone comes along in 20 years, a younger person who's absorbed all the technology and for them to be wowed, I think they have to be more deeply impressed. A young Kolmogorov would not be wowed by some of the stunts that you see right now coming from the big companies. The demos, but do you think the breakthroughs from Kolmogorov would be, and give this question a chance, do you think there'll be in the scientific fundamental principles arena or do you think it's possible to have fundamental breakthroughs in engineering? Meaning, you know, I would say some of the things that Elon Musk is working with SpaceX and then others sort of trying to revolutionize the fundamentals of engineering, of manufacturing, of saying, here's a problem we know how to do a demo of and actually taking it to scale. Yeah. So there's going to be all kinds of breakthroughs. I just don't like that terminology. I'm a scientist and I work on things day in and day out and things move along and eventually you say, wow, something happened, but I don't like that language very much. Also I don't like to prize theoretical breakthroughs over practical ones. I tend to be more of a theoretician and I think there's lots to do in that arena right now. And so I wouldn't point to the Kolmogorovs, I might point to the Edisons of the era and maybe Musk is a bit more like that. But you know, Musk, God bless him, also will say things about AI that he knows very little about and he leads people astray when he talks about things he doesn't know anything about. Trying to program a computer to understand natural language, to be involved in a dialogue we're having right now, that ain't going to happen in our lifetime. You could fake it, you can mimic, sort of take old sentences that humans use and retread them, but the deep understanding of language, no, it's not going to happen. And so from that, I hope you can perceive that the deeper, yet deeper kind of aspects and intelligence are not going to happen. Now will there be breakthroughs? No, I think that Google was a breakthrough, I think Amazon is a breakthrough, you know, I think Uber is a breakthrough, you know, that bring value to human beings at scale in new, brand new ways based on data flows and so on. A lot of these things are slightly broken because there's not kind of an engineering field that takes economic value in context of data and, you know, planetary scale and worries about all the externalities, the privacy, you know, we don't have that field so we don't think these things through very well. I see that as emerging and that will be, you know, looking back from 100 years, that will be a constituted breakthrough in this era, just like electrical engineering was a breakthrough in the early part of the last century and chemical engineering was a breakthrough. So the scale, the markets that you talk about and we'll get to will be seen as sort of breakthrough and we're in the very early days of really doing interesting stuff there and we'll get to that, but just taking a quick step back, can you give, kind of throw off the historian hat. I mean, you briefly said that the history of AI kind of mimics the history of chemical engineering, but... I keep saying machine learning. You keep wanting to say AI, just to let you know, I don't, you know, I resist that. I don't think this is about AI really was John McCarthy as almost a philosopher saying, wouldn't it be cool if we could put thought in a computer? If we could mimic the human capability to think or put intelligence in, in some sense into a computer. That's an interesting philosophical question and he wanted to make it more than philosophy. He wanted to actually write down a logical formula and algorithms that would do that. And that is a perfectly valid, reasonable thing to do. That's not what's happening in this era. So the reason I keep saying AI actually, and I'd love to hear what you think about it. Machine learning has a very particular set of methods and tools. Maybe your version of it is that mine doesn't, it's very, very open. It does optimization, it does sampling, it does... So systems that learn is what machine learning is. Systems that learn and make decisions. And make decisions. So it's not just pattern recognition and, you know, finding patterns, it's all about making decisions in real worlds and having close feedback loops. So something like symbolic AI, expert systems, reasoning systems, knowledge based representation, all of those kinds of things, search, does that neighbor fit into what you think of as machine learning? So I don't even like the word machine learning, I think that what the field you're talking about is all about making large collections of decisions under uncertainty by large collections of entities. Right? And there are principles for that, at that scale. You don't have to say the principles are for a single entity that's making decisions, single agent or single human. It really immediately goes to the network of decisions. Is a good word for that or no? No, there's no good words for any of this. That's kind of part of the problem. So we can continue the conversation to use AI for all that. I just want to kind of raise the flag here that this is not about, we don't know what intelligence is and real intelligence. We don't know much about abstraction and reasoning at the level of humans. We don't have a clue. We're not trying to build that because we don't have a clue. Eventually it may emerge. They'll make, I don't know if there'll be breakthroughs, but eventually we'll start to get glimmers of that. It's not what's happening right now. Okay. We're taking data. We're trying to make good decisions based on that. We're trying to scale. We're trying to economically viably, we're trying to build markets. We're trying to keep value at that scale and aspects of this will look intelligent. Computers were so dumb before, they will seem more intelligent. We will use that buzzword of intelligence so we can use it in that sense. So machine learning, you can scope it narrowly as just learning from data and pattern recognition. But when I talk about these topics, maybe data science is another word you could throw in the mix, it really is important that the decisions are as part of it. It's consequential decisions in the real world. Am I going to have a medical operation? Am I going to drive down the street? Things where there's scarcity, things that impact other human beings or other environments and so on. How do I do that based on data? How do I do that adaptively? How do I use computers to help those kinds of things go forward? Whatever you want to call that. So let's call it AI. Let's agree to call it AI, but let's not say that the goal of that is intelligence. The goal of that is really good working systems at planetary scale that we've never seen before. So reclaim the word AI from the Dartmouth conference from many decades ago of the dream of humans. I don't want to reclaim it. I want a new word. I think it was a bad choice. I mean, if you read one of my little things, the history was basically that McCarthy needed a new name because cybernetics already existed and he didn't like, no one really liked Norbert Wiener. Norbert Wiener was kind of an island to himself and he felt that he had encompassed all this and in some sense he did. You look at the language of cybernetics, it was everything we're talking about. It was control theory and signal processing and some notions of intelligence and closed feedback loops and data. It was all there. It's just not a word that lived on partly because of the maybe the personalities. But McCarthy needed a new word to say, I'm different from you. I'm not part of your show. I got my own. Invented this word and again, thinking forward about the movies that would be made about it, it was a great choice. But thinking forward about creating a sober academic and real world discipline, it was a terrible choice because it led to promises that are not true that we understand. We understand artificial perhaps, but we don't understand intelligence. It's a small tangent because you're one of the great personalities of machine learning, whatever the heck you call the field. Do you think science progresses by personalities or by the fundamental principles and theories and research that's outside of personalities? Both. And I wouldn't say there should be one kind of personality. I have mine and I have my preferences and I have a kind of network around me that feeds me and some of them agree with me and some of them disagree, but all kinds of personalities are needed. Right now, I think the personality that it's a little too exuberant, a little bit too ready to promise the moon is a little bit too much in ascendance. And I do think that there's some good to that. It certainly attracts lots of young people to our field, but a lot of those people come in with strong misconceptions and they have to then unlearn those and then find something to do. And so I think there's just got to be some multiple voices and I wasn't hearing enough of the more sober voice. So as a continuation of a fun tangent and speaking of vibrant personalities, what would Yeah. And you think technically speaking, it's possible to help. I don't know the answers, but it's a, it's a, it's a less anonymity, a little more locality, you know, worlds that you kind of enter in and you trust the people there in those worlds so that when you start having a discussion, you know, not only is that people are not going to hurt you, but it's not going to be a total waste of your time because there's a lot of wasting of time that, you know, a lot of us, I pulled out of Facebook early on cause it was clearly going to waste a lot of my time even though there was some value. And so, yeah, worlds that are somehow you enter in and you know what you're getting and it's kind of appeals to you and you might, new things might happen, but you kind of have some, some trust in that world. And there's some deep, interesting, complex psychological aspects around anonymity, how that changes human behavior that's quite dark. Quite dark. Yeah. I think a lot of us are, especially those of us who really loved the advent of technology. I love social networks when they came out. I was just, I didn't see any negatives there at all. But then I started seeing comment sections. I think it was maybe, you know, with the CNN or something. And I started to go, wow, this, this darkness I just did not know about and, and our technology is now amplifying it. So sorry for the big philosophical question, but on that topic, do you think human beings, cause you've also, out of all things, had a foot in psychology too, the, do you think human beings are fundamentally good? Like all of us have good intent that could be mind or is it depending on context and environment, everybody could be evil. So my answer is fundamentally good. But fundamentally limited. All of us have very, you know, blinkers on. We don't see the other person's pain that easily. We don't see the other person's point of view that easily. We're very much in our own head, in our own world. And on my good days, I think the technology could open us up to, you know, more perspectives and more less blinkered and more understanding, you know, a lot of wars in human history happened because of just ignorance. They didn't, they, they thought the other person was doing this while their person wasn't doing this. And we have a huge amounts of that. But in my lifetime, I've not seen technology really help in that way yet. And I do, I do, I do believe in that, but you know, no, I think fundamentally humans are good. The people suffer, people have grievances because you have grudges and those things cause them to do things they probably wouldn't want. They regret it often. So no, I, I think it's a, you know, part of the progress of technology is to indeed allow it to be a little easier to be the real good person you actually are. Well, but do you think individual human life or society could be modeled as an optimization problem? Not the way I think typically, I mean, that's, you're talking about one of the most complex phenomenon in the whole, you know, in all of which the individual human life or society as a whole. Both, both. I mean, individual human life is amazingly complex. And so you know, optimization is kind of just one branch of mathematics that talks about certain kinds of things. And it just feels way too limited for the complexity of such things. What properties of optimization problems do you think, so do you think most interesting problems that could be solved through optimization, what kind of properties does that surface have non convexity, convexity, linearity, all those kinds of things, saddle points? Well, so optimization is just one piece of mathematics. You know, there's like, you just, even in our era, we're aware that say sampling is coming up, examples of something coming up with a distribution. What's optimization? What's sampling? Well, they, you can, if you're a kind of a certain kind of mathematician, you can try to blend them and make them seem to be sort of the same thing. But optimization is roughly speaking, trying to find a point that, a single point that is the optimum of a criterion function of some kind. And sampling is trying to, from that same surface, treat that as a distribution or density and find points that have high density. So I want the entire distribution in a sampling paradigm and I want the, you know, the single point, that's the best point in the optimization paradigm. Now if you were optimizing in the space of probability measures, the output of that could be a whole probability distribution. So you can start to make these things the same. But in mathematics, if you go too high up that kind of abstraction hierarchy, you start to lose the, you know, the ability to do the interesting theorems. So you kind of don't try that. You don't try to overly over abstract. So as a small tangent, what kind of worldview do you find more appealing? One that is deterministic or stochastic? Well, that's easy. I mean, I'm a statistician. You know, the world is highly stochastic. I don't know what's going to happen in the next five minutes, right? Because what you're going to ask, what we're going to do, what I'll say. Due to the uncertainty. Due to the... Massive uncertainty. Yeah. You know, massive uncertainty. And so the best I can do is have come rough sense or probability distribution on things and somehow use that in my reasoning about what to do now. So how does the distributed at scale when you have multi agent systems look like? So optimization can optimize sort of, it makes a lot more sense, sort of at least from my from robotics perspective, for a single robot, for a single agent, trying to optimize some objective function. When you start to enter the real world, this game theoretic concept starts popping up. That's how do you see optimization in this? Because you've talked about markets in a scale. What does that look like? Do you see it as optimization? Do you see it as sampling? Do you see like, how should you mark? These all blend together. And a system designer thinking about how to build an incentivized system will have a blend of all these things. So, you know, a particle in a potential well is optimizing a functional called a Lagrangian, right? The particle doesn't know that. There's no algorithm running that does that. It just happens. And so it's a description mathematically of something that helps us understand as analysts what's happening, right? And so the same thing will happen when we talk about, you know, mixtures of humans and computers and markets and so on and so forth, there'll be certain principles that allow us to understand what's happening, whether or not the actual algorithms are being used by any sense is not clear. Now at some point, I may have set up a multi agent or market kind of system. And I'm now thinking about an individual agent in that system. And they're asked to do some task and they're incentivized in some way, they get certain signals and they have some utility. What they will do at that point is they just won't know the answer, they may have to optimize to find an answer. Okay, so an artist could be embedded inside of an overall market. You know, and game theory is very, very broad. It is often studied very narrowly for certain kinds of problems. But it's roughly speaking, this is just the, I don't know what you're going to do. So I kind of anticipate that a little bit, and you anticipate what I'm anticipating. And we kind of go back and forth in our own minds. We run kind of thought experiments. You've talked about this interesting point in terms of game theory, you know, most optimization problems really hate saddle points, maybe you can describe what saddle points are. But I've heard you kind of mentioned that there's a there's a branch of optimization that you could try to explicitly look for saddle points as a good thing. Oh, not optimization. That's just game theory that that so there's all kinds of different equilibria in game theory. And some of them are highly explanatory behavior. They're not attempting to be algorithmic. They're just trying to say, if you happen to be at this equilibrium, you would see certain kind of behavior. And we see that in real life. That's what an economist wants to do, especially behavioral economists in continuous differential game theory, you're in continuous spaces, a some of the simplest equilibria are saddle points and Nash equilibrium as a saddle point. It's a special kind of saddle point. So classically, in game theory, you were trying to find Nash equilibria and an algorithmic game theory, you're trying to find algorithms that would find them. And so you're trying to find saddle points. I mean, so that's literally what you're trying to do. But you know, any economist knows that Nash equilibria have their limitations. They are definitely not that explanatory in many situations. They're not what you really want. There's other kind of equilibria. And there's names associated with these because they came from history with certain people working on them, but there will be new ones emerging. So you know, one example is a Stackelberg equilibrium. So you know, Nash, you and I are both playing this game against each other or for each other, maybe it's cooperative, and we're both going to think it through and then we're going to decide and we're going to do our thing simultaneously. You know, in a Stackelberg, no, I'm going to be the first mover. I'm going to make a move. You're going to look at my move and then you're going to make yours. Now since I know you're going to look at my move, I anticipate what you're going to do. And so I don't do something stupid, but then I know that you are also anticipating me. So we're kind of going back and forth on why, but there is then a first mover thing. And so those are different equilibria, right? And so just mathematically, yeah, these things have certain topologies and certain shapes that are like, what's it, algorithmically or dynamically, how do you move towards them? How do you move away from things? You know, so some of these questions have answers, they've been studied, others do not. And especially if it becomes stochastic, especially if there's large numbers of decentralized things, there's just, you know, young people get in this field who kind of think it's all done because we have, you know, TensorFlow. Well, no, these are all open problems and they're really important and interesting. And it's about strategic settings. How do I collect data? Suppose I don't know what you're going to do because I don't know you very well, right? Well, I got to collect data about you. So maybe I want to push you into a part of the space where I don't know much about you so I can get data. Cause, and then later I'll realize that you'll never, you'll never go there because of the way the game is set up. You know, that's part of the overall, you know, data analysis context is that. Even the game of poker is fascinating space, whenever there's any uncertainty, a lack of information, it's a super exciting space. Just to linger on optimization for a second. So when we look at deep learning, it's essentially minimization of a complicated loss function. So is there something insightful or hopeful that you see in the kinds of function surface that loss functions, the deep learning and in the real world is trying to optimize over? Is there something interesting as it's just the usual kind of problems of optimization? I think from an optimization point of view, that surface, first of all, it's pretty smooth. And secondly, if there's over, if it's over parameterized, there's kind of lots of paths down to reasonable Optima. And so kind of the getting downhill to the, to an optimum is viewed as not as hard as you might've expected in high dimensions. The fact that some Optima tend to be really good ones and others not so good. And you tend to, it's not, sometimes you find the good ones is sort of still needs explanation. Yeah. But, but the particular surface is coming from the particular generation of neural nets. I kind of suspect those will, those will change in 10 years. It will not be exactly those surfaces. There'll be some others that are an optimization theory will help contribute to why other surfaces or why other algorithms. Years of arithmetic operations with a little bit of nonlinearity, that's not, that didn't come from neuroscience per se. I mean, maybe in the minds of some of the people working on it, they were thinking about brains, but they were arithmetic circuits in all kinds of fields, computer science control theory and so on. And that layers of these could transform things in certain ways. And that if it's smooth, maybe you could find parameter values is a sort of big discovery that it's working, it's able to work at this scale. But I don't think that we're stuck with that and we're, we're certainly not stuck with that cause we're understanding the brain. So in terms of on the algorithm side sort of gradient descent, do you think we're stuck with gradient descent as a variance of it? What variance do you find interesting or do you think there'll be something else invented that is able to walk all over these optimization spaces in more interesting ways? So there's a co design of the surface and the, or the architecture and the algorithm. So if you just ask if we stay with the kind of architectures that we have now and not just neural nets, but you know, phase retrieval architectures or matrix completion architectures and so on. You know, I think we've kind of come to a place where yeah, a stochastic gradient algorithms are dominant and there are versions that are a little better than others. They have more guarantees, they're more robust and so on. And there's ongoing research to kind of figure out which is the best arm for which situation. But I think that that'll start to co evolve, that that'll put pressure on the actual architecture. And so we shouldn't do it in this particular way, we should do it in a different way because this other algorithm is now available if you do it in a different way. So that I can't really anticipate that co evolution process, but you know, gradients are amazing mathematical objects. They have a lot of people who start to study them more deeply mathematically are kind of shocked about what they are and what they can do. Think about it this way, suppose that I tell you if you move along the x axis, you go uphill in some objective by three units, whereas if you move along the y axis, you go uphill by seven units, right? Now I'm going to only allow you to move a certain unit distance, right? What are you going to do? Well, most people will say that I'm going to go along the y axis, I'm getting the biggest bang for my buck, you know, and my buck is only one unit, so I'm going to put all of it in the y axis, right? And why should I even take any of my strength, my step size and put any of it in the x axis because I'm getting less bang for my buck. That seems like a completely clear argument and it's wrong because the gradient direction is not to go along the y axis, it's to take a little bit of the x axis. And to understand that, you have to know some math and so even a trivial so called operator like gradient is not trivial and so, you know, exploiting its properties is still very important. Now we know that just pervading descent has got all kinds of problems, it gets stuck in many ways and it had never, you know, good dimension dependence and so on. So my own line of work recently has been about what kinds of stochasticity, how can we get dimension dependence, how can we do the theory of that and we've come up pretty favorable results with certain kinds of stochasticity. We have sufficient conditions generally. We know if you do this, we will give you a good guarantee. We don't have necessary conditions that it must be done a certain way in general. So stochasticity, how much randomness to inject into the walking along the gradient? And what kind of randomness? Why is randomness good in this process? Why is stochasticity good? Yeah, so I can give you simple answers but in some sense again, it's kind of amazing. Stochasticity just, you know, particular features of a surface that could have hurt you if you were doing one thing deterministically won't hurt you because by chance, there's very little chance that you would get hurt. So here stochasticity, it just kind of saves you from some of the particular features of surfaces. In fact, if you think about surfaces that are discontinuous in our first derivative, like an absolute value function, you will go down and hit that point where there's nondifferentiability. And if you're running a deterministic algorithm at that point, you can really do something bad. Whereas stochasticity just means it's pretty unlikely that's going to happen, that you're going to hit that point. So it's again, nontrivial to analyze but especially in higher dimensions, also stochasticity, our intuition isn't very good about it but it has properties that kind of are very appealing in high dimensions for a lot of large number of reasons. So it's all part of the mathematics to kind of, that's what's fun to work in the field is that you get to try to understand this mathematics. But long story short, you know, partly empirically, it was discovered stochastic gradient is very effective and theory kind of followed, I'd say, that but I don't see that we're getting clearly out of that. What's the most beautiful, mysterious, a profound idea to you in optimization? I don't know the most. But let me just say that Nesterov's work on Nesterov acceleration to me is pretty surprising and pretty deep. Can you elaborate? Well Nesterov acceleration is just that, suppose that we are going to use gradients to move around in a space. For the reasons I've alluded to, they're nice directions to move. And suppose that I tell you that you're only allowed to use gradients, you're not going to be allowed to use this local person that can only sense kind of the change in the surface. But I'm going to give you kind of a computer that's able to store all your previous gradients. And so you start to learn some something about the surface. And I'm going to restrict you to maybe move in the direction of like a linear span of all the gradients. So you can't kind of just move in some arbitrary direction, right? So now we have a well defined mathematical complexity model. There's certain classes of algorithms that can do that and others that can't. And we can ask for certain kinds of surfaces, how fast can you get down to the optimum? So there's answers to these. So for a smooth convex function, there's an answer, which is one over the number of steps squared. You will be within a ball of that size after k steps. Gradient descent in particular has a slower rate, it's one over k. So you could ask, is gradient descent actually, even though we know it's a good algorithm, is it the best algorithm? And the answer is no. Well, not clear yet, because one over k squared is a lower bound. That's probably the best you can do. Gradient is one over k, but is there something better? And so I think as a surprise to most, Nesterov discovered a new algorithm that has got two pieces to it. It's two gradients and puts those together in a certain kind of obscure way. And the thing doesn't even move downhill all the time. It sometimes goes back uphill. And if you're a physicist, that kind of makes some sense. You're building up some momentum and that is kind of the right intuition, but that intuition is not enough to understand kind of how to do it and why it works. But it does. It achieves one over k squared and it has a mathematical structure and it's still kind of to this day, a lot of us are writing papers and trying to explore that and understand it. So there are lots of cool ideas and optimization, but just kind of using gradients, I think is number one that goes back, you know, 150 years. And then Nesterov, I think has made a major contribution with this idea. So like you said, gradients themselves are in some sense, mysterious. They're not as trivial as... Not as trivial. Coordinate descent is more of a trivial one. You just pick one of the coordinates. That's how we think. That's how our human mind thinks. That's how our human minds think. And gradients are not that easy for our human mind to grapple with. An absurd question, but what is statistics? So here it's a little bit, it's somewhere between math and science and technology. It's somewhere in that convex hole. So it's a set of principles that allow you to make inferences that have got some reason to be believed and also principles that allow you to make decisions where you can have some reason to believe you're not going to make errors. So all of that requires some assumptions about what do you mean by an error? What do you mean by the probabilities? But after you start making some of those assumptions, you're led to conclusions that, yes, I can guarantee that if you do this in this way, your probability of making an error will be small. Your probability of continuing to not make errors over time will be small. And the probability that you found something that's real will be small, will be high. So decision making is a big part of that. Decision making is a big part. Yeah. So statistics, short history was that, it goes back as a formal discipline, 250 years or so. It was called inverse probability because around that era, probability was developed sort of especially to explain gambling situations. Of course, interesting. So you would say, well, given the state of nature is this, there's a certain roulette board that has a certain mechanism and what kind of outcomes do I expect to see? And especially if I do things long amounts of time, what outcomes will I see? And the physicists started to pay attention to this. And then people said, well, let's turn the problem around. What if I saw certain outcomes, could I infer what the underlying mechanism was? That's an inverse problem. And in fact, for quite a while, statistics was called inverse probability. That was the name of the field. And I believe that it was Laplace who was working in Napoleon's government who needed to do a census of France, learn about the people there. So he went and gathered data and he analyzed that data to determine policy and said, well, let's call this field that does this kind of thing statistics because the word state is in there. In French, that's etat, but it's the study of data for the state. So anyway, that caught on and it's been called statistics ever since. But by the time it got formalized, it was sort of in the 30s. And around that time, there was game theory and decision theory developed nearby. People in that era didn't think of themselves as either computer science or statistics or control or econ. They were all the above. And so Von Neumann is developing game theory, but also thinking of that as decision theory. Wald is an econometrician developing decision theory and then turning that into statistics. And so it's all about, here's not just data and you analyze it, here's a loss function. Here's what you care about. Here's the question you're trying to ask. Here is a probability model and here's the risk you will face if you make certain decisions. And to this day, in most advanced statistical curricula, you teach decision theory as the starting point and then it branches out into the two branches of Bayesian and frequentist. But that's all about decisions. In statistics, what is the most beautiful, mysterious, maybe surprising idea that you've come across? Yeah, good question. I mean, there's a bunch of surprising ones. There's something that's way too technical for this thing, but something called James Stein estimation, which is kind of surprising and really takes time to wrap your head around. Can you try to maybe... I think I don't want to even want to try. Let me just say a colleague at Steven Stigler at University of Chicago wrote a really beautiful paper on James Stein estimation, which helps to... It's views a paradox. It kind of defeats the mind's attempts to understand it, but you can and Steve has a nice perspective on that. So one of the troubles with statistics is that it's like in physics that are in quantum physics, you have multiple interpretations. There's a wave and particle duality in physics and you get used to that over time, but it still kind of haunts you that you don't really quite understand the relationship. The electron's a wave and electron's a particle. Well the same thing happens here. There's Bayesian ways of thinking and frequentist, and they are different. They sometimes become sort of the same in practice, but they are physically different. And then in some practice, they are not the same at all. They give you rather different answers. And so it is very much like wave and particle duality, and that is something that you have to kind of get used to in the field. Can you define Bayesian and frequentist? Yeah in decision theory you can make, I have a video that people could see. It's called are you a Bayesian or a frequentist and kind of help try to make it really clear. It comes from decision theory. So you know, decision theory, you're talking about loss functions, which are a function of data X and parameter theta. They're a function of two arguments. Okay. Neither one of those arguments is known. You don't know the data a priori. It's random and the parameters unknown. All right. So you have a function of two things you don't know, and you're trying to say, I want that function to be small. I want small loss, right? Well what are you going to do? So you sort of say, well, I'm going to average over these quantities or maximize over them or something so that, you know, I turn that uncertainty into something certain. So you could look at the first argument and average over it, or you could look at the second argument and average over it. That's Bayesian and frequentist. So the frequentist says, I'm going to look at the X, the data, and I'm going to take that as random and I'm going to average over the distribution. So I take the expectation loss under X. Theta is held fixed, right? That's called the risk. And so it's looking at other, all the data sets you could get, right? And say, how well will a certain procedure do under all those data sets? That's called a frequentist guarantee, right? So I think it is very appropriate when like you're building a piece of software and you're shipping it out there and people are using it on all kinds of data sets. You want to have a stamp, a guarantee on it that as people run it on many, many data sets that you never even thought about that 95% of the time it will do the right thing. Perfectly reasonable. The Bayesian perspective says, well, no, I'm going to look at the other argument of the loss function, the theta part, okay? That's unknown and I'm uncertain about it. So I could have my own personal probability for what it is, you know, how many tall people are there out there? I'm trying to infer the average height of the population while I have an idea roughly what the height is. So I'm going to average over the theta. So now that loss function as only now, again, one argument's gone, now it's a function of X and that's what a Bayesian does is they say, well, let's just focus on the particular X we got, the data set we got, we condition on that. Conditional on the X, I say something about my loss. That's a Bayesian approach to things. And the Bayesian will argue that it's not relevant to look at all the other data sets you could have gotten and average over them, the frequentist approach. It's really only the data sets you got, right? And I do agree with that, especially in situations where you're working with a scientist, you can learn a lot about the domain and you're really only focused on certain kinds of data and you gathered your data and you make inferences. I don't agree with it though, that, you know, in the sense that there are needs for frequentist guarantees, you're writing software, people are using it out there, you want to say something. So these two things have to got to fight each other a little bit, but they have to blend. So long story short, there's a set of ideas that are right in the middle that are called empirical Bayes. And empirical Bayes sort of starts with the Bayesian framework. It's kind of arguably philosophically more, you know, reasonable and kosher. Write down a bunch of the math that kind of flows from that, and then realize there's a bunch of things you don't know because it's the real world and you don't know everything. So you're uncertain about certain quantities. At that point, ask, is there a reasonable way to plug in an estimate for those things? Okay. And in some cases, there's quite a reasonable thing to do, to plug in, there's a natural thing you can observe in the world that you can plug in and then do a little bit more mathematics and assure yourself it's really good. So based on math or based on human expertise, what's, what, what are good? Oh, they're both going in. The Bayesian framework allows you to put a lot of human expertise in, but the math kind of guides you along that path and then kind of reassures you the end, you could put that stamp of approval under certain assumptions, this thing will work. So you asked the question, what's my favorite, you know, or what's the most surprising, nice idea. So one that is more accessible is something called false discovery rate, which is, you know, you're making not just one hypothesis test or making one decision, you're making a whole bag of them. And in that bag of decisions, you look at the ones where you made a discovery, you announced that something interesting had happened. All right. That's going to be some subset of your big bag. In the ones you made a discovery, which subset of those are bad? Or false, false discoveries. You'd like the fraction of your false discoveries among your discoveries to be small. That's a different criterion than accuracy or precision or recall or sensitivity and specificity. It's a different quantity. Those latter ones are almost all of them have more of a frequentist flavor. They say, given the truth is that the null hypothesis is true. Here's what accuracy I would get, or given that the alternative is true, here's what I would get. So it's kind of going forward from the state of nature to the data. The Bayesian goes the other direction from the data back to the state of nature. And that's actually what false discovery rate is. It says, given you made a discovery, okay, that's conditioned on your data. What's the probability of the hypothesis? It's going the other direction. And so the classical frequency look at that, well, I can't know that there's some priors needed in that. And the empirical Bayesian goes ahead and plows forward and starts writing down these formulas and realizes at some point, some of those things can actually be estimated in a reasonable way. And so it's kind of, it's a beautiful set of ideas. So I, this kind of line of argument has come out. It's not certainly mine, but it sort of came out from Robbins around 1960. Brad Efron has written beautifully about this in various papers and books. And the FDR is, you know, Benjamin in Israel, John Story did this Bayesian interpretation and so on. And he used to absorb these things over the years and find it a very healthy way to think about statistics. Let me ask you about intelligence to jump slightly back out into philosophy, perhaps. You said that maybe you can elaborate, but you said that defining just even the question of what is intelligence is a very difficult question. Is it a useful question? Do you think we'll one day understand the fundamentals of human intelligence and what it means, you know, have good benchmarks for general intelligence that we put before our machines? So I don't work on these topics so much that you're really asking the question for a psychologist really. And I studied some, but I don't consider myself at least an expert at this point. You know, a psychologist aims to understand human intelligence, right? And I think many psychologists I know are fairly humble about this. They might try to understand how a baby understands, you know, whether something's a solid or liquid or whether something's hidden or not. And maybe how a child starts to learn the meaning of certain words, what's a verb, what's a noun and also, you know, slowly but surely trying to figure out things. But humans ability to take a really complicated environment, reason about it, abstract about it, find the right abstractions, communicate about it, interact and so on is just, you know, really staggeringly rich and complicated. And so, you know, I think in all humility, we don't think we're kind of aiming for that in the near future. A certain psychologist doing experiments with babies in the lab or with people talking has a much more limited aspiration. And you know, Kahneman and Tversky would look at our reasoning patterns and they're not deeply understanding all the how we do our reasoning, but they're sort of saying, hey, here's some oddities about the reasoning and some things you should think about it. But also, as I emphasize in some things I've been writing about, you know, AI, the revolution hasn't happened yet. Yeah. Great blog post. I've been emphasizing that, you know, if you step back and look at intelligent systems of any kind and whatever you mean by intelligence, it's not just the humans or the animals or, you know, the plants or whatever, you know, so a market that brings goods into a city, you know, food to restaurants or something every day is a system. It's a decentralized set of decisions. Looking at it from far enough away, it's just like a collection of neurons. Every neuron is making its own little decisions, presumably in some way. And if you step back enough, every little part of an economic system is making all of its decisions. And just like with the brain, who knows what an individual neuron does and what the overall goal is, right? But something happens at some aggregate level, same thing with the economy. People eat in a city and it's robust. It works at all scales, small villages to big cities. It's been working for thousands of years. It works rain or shine, so it's adaptive. So all the kind of, you know, those are adjectives one tends to apply to intelligent systems. Robust, adaptive, you know, you don't need to keep adjusting it, self healing, whatever. Plus not perfect. You know, intelligences are never perfect and markets are not perfect. But I do not believe in this era that you cannot, that you can say, well, our computers are, our humans are smart, but you know, no markets are not, more markets are. So they are intelligent. Now we humans didn't evolve to be markets. We've been participating in them, right? But we are not ourselves a market per se. The neurons could be viewed as the market. There's economic, you know, neuroscience kind of perspective. That's interesting to pursue all that. The point though is, is that if you were to study humans and really be the world's best psychologist studied for thousands of years and come up with the theory of human intelligence, you might have never discovered principles of markets, you know, supply demand curves and you know, matching and auctions and all that. Those are real principles and they lead to a form of intelligence that's not maybe human intelligence. It's arguably another kind of intelligence. There probably are third kinds of intelligence or fourth that none of us are really thinking too much about right now. So if you really, and then all of those are relevant to computer systems in the future. Certainly the market one is relevant right now. Whereas the understanding of human intelligence is not so clear that it's relevant right now. Probably not. So if you want general intelligence, whatever one means by that, or, you know, understanding intelligence in a deep sense and all that, it is definitely has to be not just human intelligence. It's gotta be this broader thing. And that's not a mystery. Markets are intelligent. So, you know, it's definitely not just a philosophical stance to say we've got to move beyond intelligence. That sounds ridiculous. Yeah. But it's not. And in that blog post, you define different kinds of like intelligent infrastructure, AI, which I really like is some of the concepts you've just been describing. Do you see ourselves, if we see earth, human civilization as a single organism, do you think the intelligence of that organism, when you think from the perspective of markets and intelligence infrastructure is increasing, is it increasing linearly? Is it increasing exponentially? What do you think the future of that intelligence? Yeah, I don't know. I don't tend to think, I don't tend to answer questions like that because you know, that's science fiction. I'm hoping to catch you off guard. Well again, because you said it's so far in the future, it's fun to ask and you'll probably, you know, like you said, predicting the future is really nearly impossible. But say as an axiom, one day we create a human level, a superhuman level intelligent, not the scale of markets, but the scale of an individual. What do you think it is, what do you think it would take to do that? Or maybe to ask another question is how would that system be different than the biological human beings that we see around us today? Is it possible to say anything interesting to that question or is it just a stupid question? It's not a stupid question, but it's science fiction. Science fiction. And so I'm totally happy to read science fiction and think about it from time in my own life. I loved, there was this like brain in a vat kind of, you know, little thing that people were talking about when I was a student, I remember, you know, imagine that, you know, between your brain and your body, there's a, you know, there's a bunch of wires, right? And suppose that every one of them was replaced with a literal wire. And then suppose that wire was turned in actually a little wireless, you know, there's a receiver and sender. So the brain has got all the senders and receiver, you know, on all of its exiting, you know, axons and all the dendrites down to the body have replaced with senders and receivers. Now you could move the body off somewhere and put the brain in a vat, right? And then you could do things like start killing off those senders and receivers one by one. And after you've killed off all of them, where is that person? You know, they thought they were out in the body walking around the world and they moved on. So those are science fiction things. Those are fun to think about. It's just intriguing about where is, what is thought, where is it and all that. And I think every 18 year old should take philosophy classes and think about these things. And I think that everyone should think about what could happen in society that's kind of bad and all that. But I really don't think that's the right thing for most of us that are my age group to be doing and thinking about. I really think that we have so many more present, you know, first challenges and dangers and real things to build and all that such that, you know, spending too much time on science fiction, at least in public for like this, I think is not what we should be doing. Maybe over beers in private. That's right. Well, I'm not going to broadcast where I have beers because this is going to go on Facebook and I don't want a lot of people showing up there. But yeah, I'll, I love Facebook, Twitter, Amazon, YouTube. I have I'm optimistic and hopeful, but maybe, maybe I don't have grounds for such optimism and hope. But let me ask, you've mentored some of the brightest sort of some of the seminal figures in the field. Can you give advice to people who are undergraduates today? What does it take to take, you know, advice on their journey if they're interested in machine learning and in the ideas of markets from economics and psychology and all the kinds of things that you've exploring? What steps should they take on that journey? Well, yeah, first of all, the door is open and second, it's a journey. I like your language there. It is not that you're so brilliant and you have great, brilliant ideas and therefore that's just, you know, that's how you have success or that's how you enter into the field. It's that you apprentice yourself, you spend a lot of time, you work on hard things, you try and pull back and you be as broad as you can, you talk to lots of people. And it's like entering in any kind of a creative community. There's years that are needed and human connections are critical to it. So, you know, I think about, you know, being a musician or being an artist or something, you don't just, you know, immediately from day one, you know, you're a genius and therefore you do it. No, you, you know, practice really, really hard on basics and you be humble about where you are and then, and you realize you'll never be an expert on everything. So you kind of pick and there's a lot of randomness and a lot of kind of luck, but luck just kind of picks out which branch of the tree you go down, but you'll go down some branch. So yeah, it's a community. So the graduate school is, I still think is one of the wonderful phenomena that we have in our, in our world. It's very much about apprenticeship with an advisor. It's very much about a group of people you belong to. It's a four or five year process. So it's plenty of time to start from kind of nothing to come up to something, you know, more, more expertise, and then to start to have your own creativity start to flower, even surprising your own self. And it's a very cooperative endeavor. I think a lot of people think of science as highly competitive and I think in some other fields it might be more so. Here it's way more cooperative than you might imagine. And people are always teaching each other something and people are always more than happy to be clear that, so I feel I'm an expert on certain kinds of things, but I'm very much not expert on lots of other things and a lot of them are relevant and a lot of them are, I should know, but should in some society, you know, you don't. So I'm always willing to reveal my ignorance to people around me so they can teach me things. And I think a lot of us feel that way about our field. So it's very cooperative. I might add it's also very international because it's so cooperative. We see no barriers. And so that the nationalism that you see, especially in the current era and everything is just at odds with the way that most of us think about what we're doing here, where this is a human endeavor and we cooperate and are very much trying to do it together for the, you know, the benefit of everybody. So last question, where and how and why did you learn French and which language is more beautiful English or French? Great question. So first of all, I think Italian is actually more beautiful than French and English. And I also speak that. So I'm married to an Italian and I have kids and we speak Italian. Anyway, all kidding aside, every language allows you to express things a bit differently. And it is one of the great fun things to do in life is to explore those things. So in fact, when I kids or teens or college students ask me what they study, I say, well, do what your heart, where your heart is, certainly do a lot of math. Math is good for everybody, but do some poetry and do some history and do some language too. You know, throughout your life, you'll want to be a thinking person. You'll want to have done that. For me, French I learned when I was, I'd say a late teen, I was living in the middle of the country in Kansas and not much was going on in Kansas with all due respect to Kansas. And so my parents happened to have some French books on the shelf and just in my boredom, I pulled them down and I found this is fun. And I kind of learned the language by reading. And when I first heard it spoken, I had no idea what was being spoken, but I realized I had somehow knew it from some previous life and so I made the connection. But then I traveled and just I love to go beyond my own barriers and my own comfort or whatever. And I found myself on trains in France next to say older people who had lived a whole life of their own. And the ability to communicate with them was special and the ability to also see myself in other people's shoes and have empathy and kind of work on that language as part of that. So after that kind of experience and also embedding myself in French culture, which is quite amazing, languages are rich, not just because there's something inherently beautiful about it, but it's all the creativity that went into it. So I learned a lot of songs, read poems, read books. And then I was here actually at MIT where we're doing the podcast today and a young professor not yet married and not having a lot of friends in the area. So I just didn't have, I was kind of a bored person. I said, I heard a lot of Italians around. There's happened to be a lot of Italians at MIT, an Italian professor for some reason. And so I was kind of vaguely understanding what they were talking about. I said, well, I should learn this language too. So I did. And then later met my spouse and Italian became a part of my life. But I go to China a lot these days. I go to Asia, I go to Europe and every time I go, I kind of am amazed by the richness of human experience and the people don't have any idea if you haven't traveled, kind of how amazingly rich and I love the diversity. It's not just a buzzword to me. It really means something. I love to embed myself with other people's experiences. And so yeah, learning language is a big part of that. I think I've said in some interview at some point that if I had millions of dollars and infinite time or whatever, what would you really work on if you really wanted to do AI? And for me, that is natural language and really done right. Deep understanding of language. That's to me, an amazingly interesting scientific challenge. One we're very far away on. One we're very far away, but good natural language. People are kind of really invested then. I think a lot of them see that's where the core of AI is that if you understand that you really help human communication, you understand something about the human mind, the semantics that come out of the human mind and I agree, I think that will be such a long time. So I didn't do that in my career just cause I kind of, I was behind in the early days. I didn't kind of know enough of that stuff. I was at MIT, I didn't learn much language and it was too late at some point to kind of spend a whole career doing that, but I admire that field and so in my little way by learning language, you know, kind of that part of my brain has been trained up. Jan was right. You truly are the Miles Davis of machine learning. I don't think there's a better place than it. Mike it was a huge honor talking to you today. Merci beaucoup. All right.

And now let me leave you with some words of wisdom from Michael I. Jordan from his blog post titled Artificial Intelligence, the revolution hasn't happened yet, calling for broadening the scope of the AI field. We should embrace the fact that what we are witnessing is the creation of a new branch of engineering. The term engineering is often invoked in a narrow sense in academia and beyond with overtones of cold, effectless machinery and negative connotations of loss of control by humans. But an engineering discipline can be what we want it to be. In the current era, we have a real opportunity to conceive of something historically new, a human centric engineering discipline. I will resist giving this emerging discipline a name, but if the acronym AI continues to be used, let's be aware of the very real limitations of this placeholder. Let's broaden our scope, tone down the hype, and recognize the serious challenges ahead. Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time. you say is the most interesting disagreement you have with Jan Lacune? So Jan's an old friend and I just say that I don't think we disagree about very much really. He and I both kind of have a let's build it kind of mentality and does it work kind of mentality and kind of concrete. We both speak French and we speak French more together and we have a lot in common. And so if one wanted to highlight a disagreement, it's not really a fundamental one. I think it's just kind of what we're emphasizing. Jan has emphasized pattern recognition and has emphasized prediction. And it's interesting to try to take that as far as you can. If you could do perfect prediction, what would that give you kind of as a thought experiment? And I think that's way too limited. We cannot do perfect prediction. We will never have the data sets that allow me to figure out what you're about ready to do, what question you're going to ask next. I have no clue. I will never know such things. Moreover, most of us find ourselves during the day in all kinds of situations we had no anticipation of that are kind of very, very novel in various ways. And in that moment, we want to think through what we want. And also there's going to be market forces acting on us. I'd like to go down that street, but now it's full because there's a crane in the street. I got it. I got to think about that. I got to think about what I might really want here. And I got to sort of think about how much it costs me to do this action versus this action. I got to think about the risks involved. A lot of our current pattern recognition and prediction systems don't do any risk evaluations. They have no error bars, right? I got to think about other people's decisions around me. I got to think about a collection of my decisions, even just thinking about like a medical treatment, you know, I'm not going to take a, the prediction of a neural net about my health, about something consequential. I'm not about ready to have a heart attack because some number is over 0.7. Even if you had all the data in the world that ever been collected about heart attacks better than any doctor ever had, I'm not going to trust the output of that neural net to predict my heart attack. I'm going to want to ask what if questions around that. I'm going to want to look at some us or other possible data I didn't have, causal things. I'm going to want to have a dialogue with a doctor about things we didn't think about when he gathered the data. You know, I could go on and on. I hope you can see. And I don't, I think that if you say predictions, everything that, that, that you're missing all of this stuff. And so prediction plus decision making is everything, but both of them are equally important. And so the field has emphasized prediction, Jan rightly so has seen how powerful that is. But at the cost of people not being aware that decision making is where the rubber really hits the road, where human lives are at stake, where risks are being taken, where you got to gather more data. You got to think about the error bars. You got to think about the consequences of your decisions on others. You got to think about the economy around your decisions, blah, blah, blah, blah. I'm not the only one working on those, but we're a smaller tribe. And right now we're not the one that people talk about the most. But you know, if you go out in the real world and industry, you know, at Amazon, I'd say half the people there are working on decision making and the other half are doing, you know, the pattern recognition. It's important. And the words of pattern recognition and prediction, I think the distinction there, not to linger on words, but the distinction there is more a constrained sort of in the lab data set versus decision making is talking about consequential decisions in the real world, under the messiness and the uncertainty of the real world. And just the whole of it, the whole mess of it that actually touches human beings and scale. And the forces, that's the distinction. It helps add those, that perspective, that broader perspective. You're right. I totally agree. On the other hand, if you're a real prediction person, of course, you want it to be in the real world. You want to predict real world events. I'm just saying that's not possible with just data sets. That it has to be in the context of, you know, strategic things that someone's doing, data they might gather, things they could have gathered, the reasoning process around data. It's not just taking data and making predictions based on the data. So one of the things that you're working on, I'm sure there's others working on it, but I don't hear often it talked about, especially in the clarity that you talk about it, and I think it's both the most exciting and the most concerning area of AI in terms of decision making. So you've talked about AI systems that help make decisions that scale in a distributed way, millions, billions decisions, sort of markets of decisions. Can you, as a starting point, sort of give an example of a system that you think about when you're thinking about these kinds of systems? Yeah, so first of all, you're absolutely getting into some territory, which I will be beyond my expertise. And there are lots of things that are going to be very not obvious to think about. Just like, again, I like to think about history a little bit, but think about put yourself back in the sixties. There was kind of a banking system that wasn't computerized really. There was database theory emerging and database people had to think about how do I actually not just move data around, but actual money and have it be, you know, valid and have transactions that ATMs happen that are actually, you know, all valid and so on and so forth. So that's the kind of issues you get into when you start to get serious about sorts of things like this. I like to think about as kind of almost a thought experiment to help me think something simpler, which is the music market. And because there is, to first order, there is no music market in the world right now and in our country, for sure. There are something called things called record companies and they make money and they prop up a few really good musicians and make them superstars and they all make huge amounts of money. But there's a long tail of huge numbers of people that make lots and lots of really good music that is actually listened to by more people than the famous people. They are not in a market. They cannot have a career. They do not make money. The creators, the creators, the creators, the so called influencers or whatever that diminishes who they are. So there are people who make extremely good music, especially in the hip hop or Latin world these days. They do it on their laptop. That's what they do on the weekend and they have another job during the week and they put it up on SoundCloud or other sites. Eventually it gets streamed. It now gets turned into bits. It's not economically valuable. The information is lost. It gets put up there. People stream it. You walk around in a big city, you see people with headphones, especially young kids listening to music all the time. If you look at the data, very little of the music they are listening to is the famous people's music and none of it's old music. It's all the latest stuff. But the people who made that latest stuff are like some 16 year old somewhere who will never make a career out of this, who will never make money. Of course there will be a few counter examples. The record companies incentivize to pick out a few and highlight them. Long story short, there's a missing market there. There is not a consumer producer relationship at the level of the actual creative acts. The pipelines and Spotify's of the world that take this stuff and stream it along, they make money off of subscriptions or advertising and those things. They're making the money. All right. And then they will offer bits and pieces of it to a few people again to highlight that they simulate a market. Anyway, a real market would be if you're a creator of music that you actually are somebody who's good enough that people want to listen to you, you should have the data available to you. There should be a dashboard showing a map of the United States. So in last week, here's all the places your songs were listened to. It should be transparent, vetable, so that if someone down in Providence sees that you're being listened to 10,000 times in Providence, that they know that's real data. You know it's real data. They will have you come give a show down there. They will broadcast to the people who've been listening to you that you're coming. If you do this right, you could go down there and make $20,000. You do that three times a year, you start to have a career. So in this sense, AI creates jobs. It's not about taking away human jobs. It's creating new jobs because it creates a new market. Once you've created a market, you've now connected up producers and consumers. The person who's making the music can say to someone who comes to their shows a lot, hey, I'll play at your daughter's wedding for $10,000. You'll say 8,000. They'll say 9,000. Then again, you can now get an income up to $100,000. You're not going to be a millionaire. And now even think about really the value of music is in these personal connections, even so much so that a young kid wants to wear a tshirt with their favorite musician's signature on it. So if they listen to the music on the internet, the internet should be able to provide them with a button that they push and the merchandise arrives the next day. We can do that. And now why should we do that? Well, because the kid who bought the shirt will be happy, but more the person who made the music will get the money. There's no advertising needed. So you can create markets between producers and consumers, take 5% cut. Your company will be perfectly sound. It'll go forward into the future and it will create new markets and that raises human happiness. Now this seems like, well, this is easy, just create this dashboard, kind of create some connections and all that. But if you think about Uber or whatever, you think about the challenges in the real world of doing things like this, and there are actually new principles going to be needed. You're trying to create a new kind of two way market at a different scale that's ever been done before. There's going to be unwanted aspects of the market. There'll be bad people. There'll be the data will get used in the wrong ways, it'll fail in some ways, it won't deliver about. You have to think that through. Just like anyone who ran a big auction or ran a big matching service in economics will think these things through. And so that maybe doesn't get at all the huge issues that can arise when you start to create markets, but it starts to, at least for me, solidify my thoughts and allow me to move forward in my own thinking. Yeah. So I talked to the head of research at Spotify actually, and I think their longterm goal, they've said, is to have at least one million creators make a comfortable living putting on Spotify. So I think you articulate a really nice vision of the world and the digital and the cyberspace of markets. What do you think companies like Spotify or YouTube or Netflix can do to create such markets? Is it an AI problem? Is it an interface problem for interface design? Is it some other kind of, is it an economics problem? Who should they hire to solve these problems? Well, part of it's not just top down. So the Silicon Valley has this attitude that they know how to do it. They will create the system just like Google did with the search box that will be so good that they'll just, everyone will adopt that. It's everything you said, but really I think missing that kind of culture. So it's literally that 16 year old who's able to create the songs. You don't create that as a Silicon Valley entity. You don't hire them per se. You have to create an ecosystem in which they are wanted and that they belong. And so you have to have some cultural credibility to do things like this. Netflix, to their credit, wanted some of that credibility and they created shows, content. They call it content. It's such a terrible word, but it's culture. And so with movies, you can kind of go give a large sum of money to somebody graduating from the USC film school. It's a whole thing of its own, but it's kind of like rich white people's thing to do. And American culture has not been so much about rich white people. It's been about all the immigrants, all the Africans who came and brought that culture and those rhythms to this world and created this whole new thing. American culture. And so companies can't artificially create that. They can't just say, hey, we're here. We're going to buy it up. You've got a partner. And so anyway, not to denigrate, these companies are all trying and they should, and I'm sure they're asking these questions and some of them are even making an effort. But it is partly a respect the culture as a technology person. You've got to blend your technology with cultural meaning. How much of a role do you think the algorithm, so machine learning has in connecting the consumer to the creator, sort of the recommender system aspect of this? Yeah. It's a great question. I think pretty high. There's no magic in the algorithms, but a good recommender system is way better than a bad recommender system. And recommender systems is a billion dollar industry back even 10, 20 years ago. And it continues to be extremely important going forward. What's your favorite recommender system, just so we can put something, well, just historically I was one of the, when I first went to Amazon, I first didn't like Amazon because they put the book people out of business or the library, the local booksellers went out of business. I've come to accept that there probably are more books being sold now and poor people reading them than ever before. And then local book stores are coming back. So that's how economics sometimes work. You go up and you go down. But anyway, when I finally started going there and I bought a few books, I was really pleased to see another few books being recommended to me that I never would have thought of. And I bought a bunch of them. So they obviously had a good business model. But I learned things and I still to this day kind of browse using that service. And I think lots of people get a lot, that is a good aspect of a recommendation system. I'm learning from my peers in an indirect way. And their algorithms are not meant to have them impose what we learn. It really is trying to find out what's in the data. It doesn't work so well for other kinds of entities, but that's just the complexity of human life. Like shirts, I'm not going to get recommendations on shirts, but that's interesting. If you try to recommend restaurants, it's hard. It's hard to do it at scale. But a blend of recommendation systems with other economic ideas, matchings and so on is really, really still very open research wise. And there's new companies that are going to emerge that do that well. What do you think is going to the messy, difficult land of say politics and things like that, that YouTube and Twitter have to deal with in terms of recommendation systems? Being able to suggest, I think Facebook just launched Facebook news. So recommend the kind of news that are most likely for you to be interesting. Do you think this is AI solvable, again, whatever term we want to use, do you think it's a solvable problem for machines or is it a deeply human problem that's unsolvable? So I don't even think about it at that level. I think that what's broken with some of these companies, it's all monetization by advertising. They're not, at least Facebook, I want to critique them, but they didn't really try to connect a producer and a consumer in an economic way, right? No one wants to pay for anything. And so they all, you know, starting with Google and Facebook, they went back to the playbook of, you know, the television companies back in the day. No one wanted to pay for this signal. They will pay for the TV box, but not for the signal, at least back in the day. And so advertising kind of filled that gap and advertising was new and interesting and it somehow didn't take over our lives quite, right? Fast forward, Google provides a service that people don't want to pay for. And so somewhat surprisingly in the nineties, they made, they ended up making huge amounts so they cornered the advertising market. It didn't seem like that was going to happen, at least to me. These little things on the right hand side of the screen just did not seem all that economically interesting, but that companies had maybe no other choice. The TV market was going away and billboards and so on. So they've, they got it. And I think that sadly that Google just has, it was doing so well with that at making such money. They didn't think much more about how, wait a minute, is there a producer consumer relationship to be set up here? Not just between us and the advertisers market to be created. Is there an actual market between the producer consumer? They're the producers, the person who created that video clip, the person that made that website, the person who could make more such things, the person who could adjust it as a function of demand, the person on the other side who's asking for different kinds of things, you know? So you see glimmers of that now there's influencers and there's kind of a little glimmering of a market, but it should have been done 20 years ago. It should have been thought about. It should have been created in parallel with the advertising ecosystem. And then Facebook inherited that. And I think they also didn't think very much about that. So fast forward and now they are making huge amounts of money off of advertising. And the news thing and all these clicks is just feeding the advertising. It's all connected up to the advertiser. So you want more people to click on certain things because that money flows to you, Facebook. You're very much incentivized to do that. And when you start to find it's breaking, people are telling you, well, we're getting into some troubles. You try to adjust it with your smart AI algorithms, right? And figure out what are bad clicks. So maybe it shouldn't be click through rate, it should be something else. I find that pretty much hopeless. It does get into all the complexity of human life and you can try to fix it. You should, but you could also fix the whole business model. And the business model is that really, what are, are there some human producers and consumers out there? Is there some economic value to be liberated by connecting them directly? Is it such that it's so valuable that people will be able to pay for it? All right. And micro payments, like small payments. Micro, but even have to be micro. So I like the example, suppose I'm going, next week I'm going to India. Never been to India before. Right? I have a couple of days in Mumbai, I have no idea what to do there. Right? And I could go on the web right now and search. It's going to be kind of hopeless. I'm not going to find, you know, I have lots of advertisers in my face. Right? What I really want to do is broadcast to the world that I am going to Mumbai and have someone on the other side of a market look at me and, and there's a recommendation system there. So I'm not looking at all possible people coming to Mumbai. They're looking at the people who are relevant to them. So someone in my age group, someone who kind of knows me in some level, I give up a little privacy by that, but I'm happy because what I'm going to get back is this person can make a little video for me, or they're going to write a little two page paper on here's the cool things that you want to do and move by this week, especially, right? I'm going to look at that. I'm not going to pay a micro payment. I'm going to pay, you know, a hundred dollars or whatever for that. It's real value. It's like journalism. Um, and as an honest subscription, it's that I'm going to pay that person in that moment. Company's going to take 5% of that. And that person has now got it. It's a gig economy, if you will, but you know, done for it, you know, thinking about a little bit behind YouTube, there was actually people who could make more of those things. If they were connected to a market, they would make more of those things independently. You don't have to tell them what to do. You don't have to incentivize them any other way. Um, and so, yeah, these companies, I don't think have thought long and hard about that. So I do distinguish on Facebook on the one side, who just not thought about these things at all. I think, uh, thinking that AI will fix everything, uh, and Amazon thinks about them all the time because they were already out in the real world. They were delivering packages, people's doors. They were, they were worried about a market. They were worried about sellers and, you know, they worry and some things they do are great. Some things maybe not so great, but you know, they're in that business model. And then I'd say Google sort of hovers somewhere in between. I don't, I don't think for a long, long time they got it. I think they probably see that YouTube is more pregnant with possibility than, than, than they might've thought and that they're probably heading that direction. Um, but uh, you know, Silicon Valley has been dominated by the Google Facebook kind of mentality and the subscription and advertising and that is, that's the core problem, right? The fake news actually rides on top of that because it means that you're monetizing with clip through rate and that is the core problem. You got to remove that. So advertisement, if we're going to linger on that, I mean, that's an interesting thesis. I don't know if everyone really deeply thinks about that. So you're right. The thought is the advertising model is the only thing we have, the only thing we'll ever have. We have to fix, we have to build algorithms that despite that business model, you know, find the better angels of our nature and do good by society and by the individual. But you think we can slowly, you think, first of all, there's a difference between should and could. So you're saying we should slowly move away from the advertising model and have a direct connection between the consumer and the creator. The question I also have is, can we, because the advertising model is so successful now in terms of just making a huge amount of money and therefore being able to build a big company that provides, has really smart people working that create a good service. Do you think it's possible? And just to clarify, you think we should move away? Well, I think we should. Yeah. But we is the, you know, me. So society. Yeah. Well, the companies, I mean, so first of all, full disclosure, I'm doing a day a week at Amazon because I kind of want to learn more about how they do things. So, you know, I'm not speaking for Amazon in any way, but, you know, I did go there because I actually believe they get a little bit of this or trying to create these markets. And they don't really use, advertising is not a crucial part of it. Well, that's a good question. So it has become not crucial, but it's become more and more present if you go to Amazon website. And, you know, without revealing too many deep secrets about Amazon, I can tell you that, you know, a lot of people in the company question this and there's a huge questioning going on. You do not want a world where there's zero advertising. That actually is a bad world. Okay. So here's a way to think about it. You're a company that like Amazon is trying to bring products to customers, right? And the customer, at any given moment, you want to buy a vacuum cleaner, say, you want to know what's available for me. And, you know, it's not going to be that obvious. You have to do a little bit of work at it. The recommendation system will sort of help, right? But now suppose this other person over here has just made the world, you know, they spent a huge amount of energy. They had a great idea. They made a great vacuum cleaner. They know they really did it. They nailed it. It's an MIT, you know, whiz kid that made a great new vacuum cleaner, right? It's not going to be in the recommendation system. No one will know about it. The algorithms will not find it and AI will not fix that. Okay. At all. Right. How do you allow that vacuum cleaner to start to get in front of people, be sold well advertising. And here, what advertising is, it's a signal that you're, you believe in your product enough that you're willing to pay some real money for it. And to me as a consumer, I look at that signal. I say, well, first of all, I know these are not just cheap little ads cause we have now right now there. I know that, you know, these are super cheap, you know, pennies. If I see an ad where it's actually, I know the company is only doing a few of these and they're making, you know, real money is kind of flowing and I see an ad, I may pay more attention to it. And I actually might want that because I see, Hey, that guy spent money on his vacuum cleaner. Maybe there's something good there. So I will look at it. And so that's part of the overall information flow in a good market. So advertising has a role, but the problem is of course that that signal is now completely gone because it just, you know, dominant by these tiny little things that add up to big money for the company, you know? So I think it will just, I think it will change because the societies just don't, you know, stick with things that annoy a lot of people and advertising currently annoys people more than it provides information. And I think that a Google probably is smart enough to figure out that this is a dead, this is a bad model, even though it's a hard, huge amount of money and they'll have to figure out how to pull it away from it slowly. And I'm sure the CEO there will figure it out, but they need to do it. And they needed it to, so if you reduce advertising, not to zero, but you reduce it at the same time you bring up producer, consumer, actual real value being delivered. So real money is being paid and they take a 5% cut that 5% could start to get big enough to cancel out the lost revenue from the kind of the poor kind of advertising. And I think that a good company will do that, will realize that. And Facebook, you know, again, God bless them. They bring, you know, grandmothers, they bring children's pictures into grandmothers lives. It's fantastic. But they need to think of a new business model and that's the core problem there. Until they start to connect producer consumer, I think they will just continue to make money and then buy the next social network company and then buy the next one and the innovation level will not be high and the health issues will not go away. So I apologize that we kind of returned to words, I don't think the exact terms matter, but in sort of defense of advertisement, don't you think the kind of direct connection between consumer and creator producer is what advertisement strives to do, right? So that is best advertisement is literally now Facebook is listening to our conversation and heard that you're going to India and will be able to actually start automatically for you making these connections and start giving this offer. So like, I apologize if it's just a matter of terms, but just to draw a distinction, is it possible to make advertisements just better and better and better algorithmically to where it actually becomes a connection, almost a direct connection? That's a good question. So let's component on that. First of all, what we just talked about, I was defending advertising. Okay. So I was defending it as a way to get signals into a market that don't come any other way, especially algorithmically. It's a sign that someone spent money on it, it's a sign they think it's valuable. And if I think that if other things, someone else thinks it's valuable, and if I trust other people, I might be willing to listen. I don't trust that Facebook though, who's an intermediary between this. I don't think they care about me. Okay. I don't think they do. And I find it creepy that they know I'm going to India next week because of our conversation. Why do you think that is? So what, could you just put your PR hat on? Why do you think you find Facebook creepy and not trust them as do majority of the population? So they're out of the Silicon Valley companies, I saw like not approval rate, but there's ranking of how much people trust companies and Facebook is in the gutter. In the gutter, including people inside of Facebook. So what do you attribute that to? Because when I... Come on, you don't find it creepy that right now we're talking that I might walk out on the street right now that some unknown person who I don't know kind of comes up to me and says, I hear you're going to India. I mean, that's not even Facebook. That's just, I want transparency in human society. I want to have, if you know something about me, there's actually some reason you know something about me. That's something that if I look at it later and audit it kind of, I approve. You know something about me because you care in some way. There's a caring relationship even, or an economic one or something. Not just that you're someone who could exploit it in ways I don't know about or care about or I'm troubled by or whatever. We're in a world right now where that happens way too much and that Facebook knows things about a lot of people and could exploit it and does exploit it at times. I think most people do find that creepy. It's not for them. It's not that Facebook is not doing it because they care about them in a real sense. And they shouldn't. They should not be a big brother caring about us. That is not the role of a company like that. Why not? Wait, not the big brother part, but the caring, the trusting. I mean, don't those companies, just to link on it because a lot of companies have a lot of information about us. I would argue that there's companies like Microsoft that has more information about us than Facebook does and yet we trust Microsoft more. Well, Microsoft is pivoting. Microsoft, you know, under Satya Nadella has decided this is really important. We don't want to do creepy things. Really want people to trust us to actually only use information in ways that they really would approve of, that we don't decide, right? And I'm just kind of adding that the health of a market is that when I connect to someone who produces a consumer, it's not just a random producer or consumer, it's people who see each other. They don't like each other, but they sense that if they transact, some happiness will go up on both sides. If a company helps me to do that in moments that I choose of my choosing, then fine. So, and also think about the difference between, you know, browsing versus buying, right? There are moments in my life I just want to buy, you know, a gadget or something. I need something for that moment. I need some ammonia for my house or something because I got a problem with a spill. I want to just go in. I don't want to be advertised at that moment. I don't want to be led down various, you know, that's annoying. I want to just go and have it be extremely easy to do what I want. Other moments I might say, no, it's like today I'm going to the shopping mall. I want to walk around and see things and see people and be exposed to stuff. So I want control over that though. I don't want the company's algorithms to decide for me, right? I think that's the thing. There's a total loss of control if Facebook thinks they should take the control from us of deciding when we want to have certain kinds of information, when we don't, what information that is, how much it relates to what they know about us that we didn't really want them to know about us. I don't want them to be helping me in that way. I don't want them to be helping them by they decide they have control over what I want and when. I totally agree. Facebook, by the way, I have this optimistic thing where I think Facebook has the kind of personal information about us that could create a beautiful thing. So I'm really optimistic of what Facebook could do. It's not what it's doing, but what it could do. So I don't see that. I think that optimism is misplaced because there's not a bit, you have to have a business model behind these things. Create a beautiful thing is really, let's be, let's be clear. It's about something that people would value. And I don't think they have that business model and I don't think they will suddenly discover it by what, you know, a long hot shower. I disagree. I disagree in terms of, you can discover a lot of amazing things in a shower. So I didn't say that. I said, they won't come, they won't do it, but in the shower, I think a lot of other people will discover it. I think that this guy, so I should also, full disclosure, there's a company called United Masters, which I'm on their board and they've created this music market and I have a hundred thousand artists now signed on and they've done things like gone to the NBA and the NBA, the music you find behind NBA clips right now is their music, right? That's a company that had the right business model in mind from the get go, right? Executed on that. And from day one, there was value brought to, so here you have a kid who made some songs who suddenly their songs are on the NBA website, right? That's real economic value to people. And so, you know, so you and I differ on the optimism of being able to sort of change the direction of the Titanic, right? So I, yeah, I'm older than you, so I've seen some Titanic's crash, got it. But and just to elaborate, cause I totally agree with you and I just want to know how difficult you think this problem is of, so for example, I want to read some news and I would, there's a lot of times in the day where something makes me either smile or think in a way where I like consciously think this really gave me value. Like I sometimes listen to the daily podcasts in the New York times, way better than the New York times themselves, by the way, for people listening. That's like real journalism is happening for some reason in the podcast space. It doesn't make sense to me, but often I listen to it 20 minutes and I would be willing to pay for that, like $5, $10 for that experience. And how difficult, that's kind of what you're getting at is that little transaction. How difficult is it to create a frictionless system like Uber has, for example, for other things? What's your intuition there? So I, first of all, I pay little bits of money to, you know, to send, there's something called courts that does financial things. I like medium as a site, I don't pay there, but I would. You had a great post on medium. I would have loved to pay you a dollar and not others. I wouldn't have wanted it per se because there should be also sites where that's not actually the goal. The goal is to actually have a broadcast channel that I monetize in some other way if I chose to. I mean, I could now people know about it. I could, I'm not doing it, but that's fine with me. Also the musicians who are making all this music, I don't think the right model is that you pay a little subscription fee to them, right? Because people can copy the bits too easily and it's just not that somewhere the value is. The value is that a connection was made between real human beings, then you can follow up on that. All right. And create yet more value. So no, I think there's a lot of open questions here, hot open questions, but also, yeah, I do want good recommendation systems that recommend cool stuff to me. But it's pretty hard, right? I don't like them to recommend stuff just based on my browsing history. I don't like the based on stuff they know about me, quote unquote. What's unknown about me is the most interesting. So this is the, this is the really interesting question. We may disagree, maybe not. I think that I love recommender systems and I want to give them everything about me in a way that I trust. Yeah. But you, but you don't, because, so for example, this morning I clicked on a, you know, I was pretty sleepy this morning. I clicked on a story about the queen of England. Yes. Right. I do not give a damn about the queen of England. I really do not. But it was clickbait. It kind of looked funny and I had to say, what the heck are they talking about? I don't want to have my life, you know, heading that direction. Now that's in my browsing history. The system in any reasonable system will think that I care about the queen of England. That's browsing history. Right. But, but you're saying all the trace, all the digital exhaust or whatever, that's been kind of the models. If you collect all this stuff, you're going to figure all of us out. Well, if you're trying to figure out like kind of one person like Trump or something, maybe you could figure him out. But if you're trying to figure out, you know, 500 million people, you know, no way, no way. You think so? No, I do. I think so. I think we are, humans are just amazingly rich and complicated. Every one of us has our little quirks, every one of us has our little things that could intrigue us that we don't even know it will intrigue us. And there's no sign of it in our past, but by God, there it comes and you know, you fall in love with it. And I don't want a company trying to figure that out for me and anticipate that I want them to provide a forum, a market, a place that I kind of go and by hook or by crook, this happens, you know, I I'm walking down the street and I hear some Chilean music being played and I never knew I liked Chilean music, but wow. So there is that side and I want them to provide a limited, but you know, interesting place to go. Right. And so don't try to use your AI to kind of, you know, figure me out and then put me in a world where you figured me out, you know, no, create huge spaces for human beings where our creativity and our style will be enriched and come forward and it'll be a lot of more transparency. I won't have people randomly, anonymously putting comments up and I'll special based on stuff they know about me, facts that, you know, we are so broken right now. If you're, you know, especially if you're a celebrity, but you know, it's about anybody that anonymous people are hurting lots and lots of people right now. That's part of this thing that Silicon Valley is thinking that, you know, just collect all this information and use it in a great way. So no, I'm not, I'm not a pessimist, I'm very much an optimist by nature, but I think that's just been the wrong path for the whole technology to take. Be more limited, create, let humans rise up. Don't try to replace them. That's the AI mantra. Don't try to anticipate them. Don't try to predict them because you're, you're, you're not going to, you're not going to be able to do those things. You're going to make things worse. Okay. So right now, just give this a chance. Right now, the recommender systems are the creepy people in the shadow watching your every move. So they're looking at traces of you. They're not directly interacting with you, sort of the, your close friends and family, the way they know you is by having conversation, by actually having interactions back and forth. Do you think there's a place for recommender systems sort of to step, cause you, you just emphasize the value of human to human connection, but yeah, just give it a chance, AI human connection. Is there a role for an AI system to have conversations with you in terms of, to try to figure out what kind of music you like, not by just watching what you listening to, but actually having a conversation, natural language or otherwise. Yeah, no, I'm, I'm, so I'm not against it. I just wanted to push back against the, maybe you're saying you have options for Facebook. So there I think it's misplaced, but, but I think that distributing, yeah, no, so good for you. Go for it. That's a hard spot to be in. Yeah, no, good. Human interaction, like on our daily, the context around me in my own home is something that I don't want some big company to know about at all, but I would be more than happy to have technology help me with it. Which kind of technology? Well, you know, just, Alexa, Amazon, well, a good, Alexa's done right. And I think Alexa is a research platform right now more than anything else. But Alexa done right, you know, could do things like I, I leave the water running in my garden and I say, Hey, Alexa, the water's running in my garden. And even have Alexa figure out that that means when my wife comes home, that she should be told about that. That's a little bit of a reasoning. I would call that AI and by any kind of stretch, it's a little bit of reasoning and it actually kind of would make my life a little easier and better. And you know, I don't, I wouldn't call this a wow moment, but I kind of think that overall rises human happiness up to have that kind of thing. But not when you're lonely, Alexa, knowing loneliness. No, no, I don't want Alexa to be, feel intrusive. And I don't want just the designer of the system to kind of work all this out. I really want to have a lot of control and I want transparency and control. And if a company can stand up and give me that in the context of new technology, I think they're good. First of all, be way more successful than our current generation. And like I said, I was mentioning Microsoft, I really think they're, they're pivoting to kind of be the trusted old uncle, but you know, I think that they get that this is a way to go, that if you let people find technology, empowers them to have more control and have and have control, not just over privacy, but over this rich set of interactions, that that people are going to like that a lot more. And that's, that's the right business model going forward. What does control over privacy look like? Do you think you should be able to just view all the data that? No, it's much more than that. I mean, first of all, it should be an individual decision. Some people don't want privacy. They want their whole life out there. Other people's want it. Privacy is not a zero one. It's not a legal thing. It's not just about which data is available, which is not. I like to recall to people that, you know, a couple hundred years ago, everyone, there was not really big cities, everyone lived in on the countryside and villages and villages. Everybody knew everything about you. Very, you didn't have any privacy. Is that bad? Are we better off now? Well, you know, arguably no, because what did you get for that loss of certain kinds of privacy? Well, people help each other if they, because they know everything about you. They know something's bad's happening, they will help you with that. Right. And now you live in a big city, no one knows about that. You get no help. So it kind of depends the answer. I want certain people who I trust and there should be relationships. I should kind of manage all those, but who knows what about me? I should have some agency there. It shouldn't, I shouldn't be a drift in a sea of technology where I have no agency. I don't want to go reading things and checking boxes. So I don't know how to do that. And I'm not a privacy researcher per se. I just, I recognize the vast complexity of this. It's not just technology. It's not just legal scholars meeting technologists. There's gotta be kind of a whole layers around it. And so I, when I alluded to this emerging engineering field, this is a big part of it. When electrical engineering came, I'm not one around at the time, but you just didn't plug electricity into walls and all kinds of work. You don't have to have like underwriters laboratory that reassured you that that plug's not going to burn up your house and that that machine will do this and that and everything. There'll be whole people who can install things. There'll be people who can watch the installers. There'll be a whole layers, you know, an onion of these kinds of things. And for things as deep and interesting as privacy, which is as least as interesting as electricity, that's going to take decades to kind of work out, but it's going to require a lot of new structures that we don't have right now. So it's kind of hard to talk about it. And you're saying there's a lot of money to be made if you get it right. So something you should look at. A lot of money to be made in all these things that provide human services and people recognize them as useful parts of their lives. So yeah. So yeah, the dialogue sometimes goes from the exuberant technologists to the no technology is good, kind of. And that's, you know, in our public discourse, you know, and as far as you see too much of this kind of thing and the sober discussions in the middle, which are the challenge he wants to have or where we need to be having our conversations. And you know, there's just not actually, there's not many forum fora for those. You know, there's, that's, that's kind of what I would look for. Maybe I could go and I could read a comment section of something and it would actually be this kind of dialogue going back and forth. You don't see much of this, right? Which is why actually there's a resurgence of podcasts out of all, because people are really hungry for conversation, but there's technology is not helping much. So comment sections of anything, including YouTube is not hurting and not helping.\",\n          \"We are becoming cyborgs. Our brains are fundamentally changed. Everyone who grew up with electronics, we are fundamentally different from previous, from homo sapiens. I call us homo techno. I think we have evolved into homo techno, which is like essentially a new species. Previous technologies, I mean, may have even been more profound and moved us to a certain degree, but I think the computers are what make us homo techno. I think this is what, it's a brain augmentation. So it like allows for actual evolution. Like the computers accelerate the degree to which all the other technologies can also be accelerated. Would you classify yourself as a homo sapien or a homo techno? Definitely homo techno. So you're one of the earliest of the species. I think most of us are. The following is a conversation with Grimes, an artist, musician, songwriter, producer, director, and a fascinating human being who thinks a lot about both the history and the future of human civilization. Studying the dark periods of our past to help form an optimistic vision of our future. This is the Lex Friedman podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here's Grimes. Oh yeah, the cloud lifter, there you go. There you go. You know your stuff. Have you ever used a cloud lifter? Yeah, I actually, this microphone cloud lifter is what Michael Jackson used, so. No, really? Yeah, this is like Thriller and stuff. This mic and a cloud lifter? Yeah, it's a incredible microphone. It's very flattering on vocals. I've used this a lot. It's great for demo vocals. It's great in a room. Sometimes it's easier to record vocals if you're just in a room and the music's playing and you just wanna feel it so it's not in the headphones. And this mic is pretty directional, so I think it's a good mic for just vibing out and just getting a real good vocal take. Just vibing, just in a room. Anyway, this is the Michael Jackson, Quincy Jones microphone. I feel way more badass now. All right, you wanna just get into it? I guess so. All right, one of your names, at least in this space and time, is C, like the letter C. And you told me that C means a lot of things. It's the speed of light. It's the render rate of the universe. It's yes in Spanish. It's the crescent moon. And it happens to be my favorite programming language because it basically runs the world, but it's also powerful, fast, and it's dangerous because you can mess things up really bad with it because of all the pointers. But anyway, which of these associations will the name C is the coolest to you? I mean, to me, the coolest is the speed of light, obviously, or the speed of light. When I say render rate of the universe, I think I mean the speed of light because essentially that's what we're rendering at. See, I think we'll know if we're in a simulation if the speed of light changes because if they can improve their render speed, then. Well, it's already pretty good. It's already pretty good, but if it improves, then we'll know, we can probably be like, okay, they've updated or upgraded. Well, it's fast enough for us humans because it seems immediate. There's no delay, there's no latency in terms of us humans on Earth interacting with things. But if you're like intergalactic species operating on a much larger scale, then you're gonna start noticing some weird stuff. Or if you can operate in like around a black hole, then you're gonna start to see some render issues. You can't go faster than the speed of light, correct? So it really limits our ability or one's ability to travel space. Theoretically, you can, you have wormholes. So there's nothing in general relativity that precludes faster than the speed of light travel. But it just seems you're gonna have to do some really funky stuff with very heavy things that have like weirdnesses, that have basically terrors in space time. We don't know how to do that. Do navigators know how to do it? Do navigators? Yeah. Folding space, basically making wormholes. So the name C. Yes. Who are you? Do you think of yourself as multiple people? Are you one person? Do you know, like in this morning, were you a different person than you are tonight? We are, I should say, recording this basically at midnight, which is awesome. Yes, thank you so much. I think I'm about eight hours late. No, you're right on time. Good morning. This is the beginning of a new day soon. Anyway, are you the same person you were in the morning and the evening? Is there multiple people in there? Do you think of yourself as one person? Or maybe you have no clue? Or are you just a giant mystery to yourself? Okay, these are really intense questions, but. Let's go, let's go. Because I asked this myself, like look in the mirror, who are you? People tell you to just be yourself, but what does that even mean? I mean, I think my personality changes with everyone I talk to. So I have a very inconsistent personality. Yeah. Person to person, so the interaction, your personality materializes. Or my mood. Like I'll go from being like a megalomaniac to being like, you know, just like a total hermit who is very shy. So some combinatorial combination of your mood and the person you're interacting with. Yeah, mood and people I'm interacting with. But I think everyone's like that. Maybe not. Well, not everybody acknowledges it and able to introspect it. Who brings out, what kind of person, what kind of mood brings out the best in you? As an artist and as a human. Can you introspect this? Like my best friends, like people I can, when I'm like super confident and I know that they're gonna understand everything I'm saying, so like my best friends, then when I can start being really funny, that's always my like peak mode. But it's like, yeah, takes a lot to get there. Let's talk about constraints. You've talked about constraints and limits. Do those help you out as an artist or as a human being? Or do they get in the way? Do you like the constraints? So in creating music, in creating art, in living life, do you like the constraints that this world puts on you? Or do you hate them? If constraints are moving, then you're good, right? Like it's like as we are progressing with technology, we're changing the constraints of like artistic creation. You know, making video and music and stuff is getting a lot cheaper. There's constantly new technology and new software that's making it faster and easier. We have so much more freedom than we had in the 70s. Like when Michael Jackson, you know, when they recorded Thriller with this microphone, like they had to use a mixing desk and all this stuff. And like probably even get in a studio, it's probably really expensive and you have to be a really good singer and you have to know how to use like the mixing desk and everything. And now I can just, you know, make I've made a whole album on this computer. I have a lot more freedom, but then I'm also constrained in different ways because there's like literally millions more artists. It's like a much bigger playing field. It's just like, I also, I didn't learn music. I'm not a natural musician. So I don't know anything about actual music. I just know about like the computer. So I'm really kind of just like messing around and like trying things out. Well, yeah, I mean, but the nature of music is changing. So you're saying you don't know actual music, what music is changing. Music is becoming, you've talked about this, is becoming, it's like merging with technology. Yes. It's becoming something more than just like the notes on a piano. It's becoming some weird composition that requires engineering skills, programming skills, some kind of human robot interaction skills, and still some of the same things that Michael Jackson had, which is like a good ear for a good sense of taste of what's good and not the final thing when it's put together. Like you're allowed, you're enabled, empowered with a laptop to layer stuff, to start like layering insane amounts of stuff. And it's super easy to do that. I do think music production is a really underrated art form. I feel like people really don't appreciate it. When I look at publishing splits, the way that people like pay producers and stuff, it's super, producers are just deeply underrated. Like so many of the songs that are popular right now or for the last 20 years, like part of the reason they're popular is because the production is really interesting or really sick or really cool. And it's like, I don't think listeners, like people just don't really understand what music production is. It's not, it's sort of like this weird, discombobulated art form. It's not like a formal, because it's so new, there isn't like a formal training path for it. It's mostly driven by like autodidacts. Like it's like almost everyone I know who's good at production, like they didn't go to music school or anything. They just taught themselves. Are they're mostly different? Like the music producers, you know, is there some commonalities that time together or are they all just different kinds of weirdos? Cause I just, I just hung out with Rick Rubin. I don't know if you've. Yeah, I mean, Rick Rubin is like literally one of the gods of music production. Like he's one of the people who first, you know, who like made music production, you know, made the production as important as the actual lyrics or the notes. But the thing he does, which is interesting, I don't know if you can speak to that, but just hanging out with him, he seems to just sit there in silence, close his eyes and listen. It's like, he almost does nothing. And that nothing somehow gives you freedom to be the best version of yourself. So that's music production somehow too, which is like encouraging you to do less, to simplify, to like push towards minimalism. I mean, I guess, I mean, I work differently from Rick Rubin cause Rick Rubin produces for other artists, whereas like I mostly produce for myself. So it's a very different situation. I also think Rick Rubin, he's in that, I would say advanced category of producer where like you've like earned your, you can have an engineer and stuff and people like do the stuff for you. But I usually just like do stuff myself. So you're the engineer, the producer and the artist. Yeah, I guess I would say I'm in the era, like the post Rick Rubin era. Like I come from the kind of like Skrillex school of thought, which is like where you are. Yeah, the engineer, producer, artist. Like where, I mean lately, sometimes I'll work with a producer now. I'm gently sort of delicately starting to collaborate a bit more, but like I think I'm kind of from the, like the whatever 2010s explosion of things where everything became available on the computer and you kind of got this like lone wizard energy thing going. So you embraced being the loneliness. Is the loneliness somehow an engine of creativity? Like, so most of your stuff, most of your creative quote unquote genius in quotes is in the privacy of your mind. Yes, well, it was, but here's the thing. I was talking to Daniel Eck and he said, he's like most artists, they have about 10 years, like 10 good years. And then they usually stop making their like vital shit. And I feel like I'm sort of like nearing the end of my 10 years on my own. So you have to become somebody else. Now I'm like, I'm in the process of becoming somebody else and reinventing. When I work with other people, because I've never worked with other people, I find that I make like, that I'm exceptionally rejuvenated and making like some of the most vital work I've ever made. So, because I think another human brain is like one of the best tools you can possibly find. Like. It's a funny way to put it, I love it. It's like if a tool is like, you know, whatever HP plus one or like adds some like stats to your character, like another human brain will like square it instead of just like adding something. Double up the experience points, I love this. We should also mention we're playing Tavern music before this and which I love, which I first, I think I first. You had to stop the Tavern music. Yeah, because it doesn't, the audio. Okay, okay. But it makes. Yeah, it'll make the podcast annoying. Add it in post, add it in post. No one will want to listen to the podcast. They probably would, but it makes me, it reminds me like of a video game, like a role playing video game where you have experience points. There's something really joyful about wandering places like Elder Scrolls, like Skyrim, just exploring these landscapes in another world and then you get experience points and you can work on different skills and somehow you progress in life. I don't know, it's simple. It doesn't have some of the messy complexities of life and there's usually a bad guy you can fight in Skyrim. It's dragons and so on. I'm sure in Elden Ring, there's a bunch of monsters you can fight. I love that. I feel like Elden Ring, I feel like this is a good analogy to music production though because it's like, I feel like the engineers and the people creating these open worlds are, it's sort of like similar to people, to music producers where it's like this hidden archetype that like no one really understands what they do and no one really knows who they are, but they're like, it's like the artist engineer because it's like, it's both art and fairly complex engineering. Well, you're saying they don't get enough credit. Aren't you kind of changing that by becoming the person doing everything? Aren't you, isn't the engineer? Well, I mean, others have gone before me. I'm not, you know, there's like Timbaland and Skrillex and there's all these people that are like, you know, very famous for this, but I just think the general, I think people get confused about what it is and just don't really know what it is per se and it's just when I see a song, like when there's like a hit song, like I'm just trying to think of like, just going for like even just a basic pop hit, like, what's it? Like Rules by Dua Lipa or something. The production on that is actually like really crazy. I mean, the song is also great, but it's like the production is exceptionally memorable. Like, you know, and it's just like no one, I can't, I don't even know who produced that song. It's just like, isn't part of like the rhetoric of how we just discuss the creation of art. We just sort of like don't consider the music producer because I think the music producer used to be more just simply recording things. Yeah, that's interesting because when you think about movies, we talk about the actor and the actresses, but we also talk about the directors. We don't talk about like that with the music as often. The Beatles music producer was one of the first kind of guy, one of the first people sort of introducing crazy sound design into pop music. I forget his name. He has the same, I forget his name, but you know, like he was doing all the weird stuff like dropping pianos and like, yeah. Oh, to get the, yeah, yeah, yeah, to get the sound, to get the authentic sound. What about lyrics? You think those, where did they fit into how important they are? I was heartbroken to learn that Elvis didn't write his songs. I was very mad. A lot of people don't write their songs. I understand this, but. But here's the thing. I feel like there's this desire for authenticity. I used to be like really mad when like people wouldn't write or produce their music and I'd be like, that's fake. And then I realized there's all this like weird bitterness and like agronus in art about authenticity. But I had this kind of like weird realization recently where I started thinking that like art is sort of a decentralized collective thing. Like art is kind of a conversation with all the artists that have ever lived before you. You know, like it's like, you're really just sort of, it's not like anyone's reinventing the wheel here. Like you're kind of just taking, you know, thousands of years of art and like running it through your own little algorithm and then like making your interpretation of it. You just joined the conversation with all the other artists that came before. It's just a beautiful way to look at it. Like, and it's like, I feel like everyone's always like, there's all this copyright and IP and this and that or authenticity. And it's just like, I think we need to stop seeing this as this like egotistical thing of like, oh, the creative genius, the lone creative genius or this or that. Because it's like, I think art shouldn't be about that. I think art is something that sort of brings humanity together. And it's also, art is also kind of the collective memory of humans. It's like, we don't give a fuck about whatever ancient Egypt, like how much grain got sent that day and sending the records and like, you know, like who went where and, you know, how many shields needed to be produced for this. Like we just remember their art. And it's like, you know, it's like in our day to day life, there's all this stuff that seems more important than art because it helps us function and survive. But when all this is gone, like the only thing that's really gonna be left is the art. The technology will be obsolete. That's so fascinating. Like the humans will be dead. That is true. A good compression of human history is the art we've generated across the different centuries, the different millennia. So when the aliens come. When the aliens come, they're gonna find the hieroglyphics and the pyramids. I mean, art could be broadly defined. They might find like the engineering marvels, the bridges, the rockets, the. I guess I sort of classify though. Architecture is art too. I consider engineering in those formats to be art, for sure. It sucks that like digital art is easier to delete. So if there's an apocalypse, a nuclear war, that can disappear. Yes. And the physical. There's something still valuable about the physical manifestation of art. That sucks that like music, for example, has to be played by somebody. Yeah, I do think we should have a foundation type situation where we like, you know how we have like seed banks up in the north and stuff? Like we should probably have like a solar powered or geothermal little bunker that like has all human knowledge. You mentioned Daniel Ek and Spotify. What do you think about that as an artist? What's Spotify? Is that empowering? To me, Spotify as a consumer is super exciting. It makes it easy for me to access music from all kinds of artists, get to explore all kinds of music, make it super easy to sort of curate my own playlist and have fun with all that. It was so liberating to let go. You know, I used to collect, you know, albums and CDs and so on, like horde albums. Yeah. Like they matter. But the reality you could, you know, that was really liberating that I could let go of that. And letting go of the albums you're kind of collecting allows you to find new music, exploring new artists and all that kind of stuff. But I know from a perspective of an artist that could be, like you mentioned, competition could be a kind of constraint because there's more and more and more artists on the platform. I think it's better that there's more artists. I mean, again, this might be propaganda because this is all from a conversation with Daniel Ek. So this could easily be propaganda. We're all a victim of somebody's propaganda. So let's just accept this. But Daniel Ek was telling me that, you know, to understand really difficult concepts just in a very different way, like an emotional intelligence about something deep within? Oh yeah, no, like if X hurts, like if X bites me really hard and I'm like, ow, like he gets, he's sad. He's like sad if he hurts me by accident. Yeah. Which he's huge, so he hurts me a lot by accident. Yeah, that's so interesting that that mind emerges and he and children don't really have memory of that time. So we can't even have a conversation with them about it. Yeah, I just thank God they don't have a memory of this time because like, think about like, I mean with our youngest baby, like it's like, I'm like, have you read the sci fi short story, I Have No Mouth But I Must Scream? Good title, no. Oh man, I mean, you should read that. I Have No Mouth But I Must Scream. I hate getting into this Rocco's Basilisk shit. It's kind of a story about the, about like an AI that's like torturing someone in eternity and they have like no body. The way they describe it, it sort of sounds like what it feels like, like being a baby, like you're conscious and you're just getting inputs from everywhere and you have no muscles and you're like jelly and you like can't move and you try to like communicate, but you can't communicate and we're, and like, you're just like in this like hell state. I think it's good we can't remember that. Like my little baby is just exiting that, like she's starting to like get muscles and have more like autonomy, but like watching her go through the opening phase, I was like, I was like, this does not seem good. Oh, you think it's kind of like. Like I think it sucks. I think it might be really violent. Like violent, mentally violent, psychologically violent. Consciousness emerging, I think is a very violent thing. I never thought about that. I think it's possible that we all carry quite a bit of trauma from it that we don't, I think that would be a good thing to study because I think if, I think addressing that trauma, like, I think that might be. Oh, you mean like echoes of it are still there in the shadows somewhere. I think it's gotta be, I feel this, this help, the helplessness, the like existential and that like fear of being in like an unknown place bombarded with inputs and being completely helpless, like that's gotta be somewhere deep in your brain and that can't be good for you. What do you think consciousness is? This whole conversation has impossibly difficult questions. What do you think it is? Debbie said this is like so hard. Yeah, we talked about music for like two minutes. All right. No, I'm so, I'm just over music. I'm over music. Yeah, I still like it. It has its purpose. No, I love music. I mean, music's the greatest thing ever. It's my favorite thing. But I just like every interview is like, what is your process? Like, I don't know. I'm just done. I can't do anything. I do want to ask you about Able to Live. Oh, I'll tell you about Ableton because Ableton's sick. No one has ever asked about Ableton though. Yeah, well, because I just need tech support mainly. I can help you. I can help you with your Ableton tech. Anyway, from Ableton back to consciousness. What do you, do you think this is a thing that only humans are capable of? Can robots be conscious? Can, like when you think about entities, you think there's aliens out there that are conscious? Like is conscious, what is consciousness? There's this Terrence McKenna quote that I've found that I fucking love. Am I allowed to swear on here? Yes. Nature loves courage. You make the commitment and nature will respond to that commitment by removing impossible obstacles. Dream the impossible dream and the world will not grind you under. It will lift you up. This is the trick. This is what all these teachers and philosophers who really counted, who really touched the alchemical gold, this is what they understood. This is the shamanic dance in the waterfall. This is how magic is done. By hurling yourself into the abyss and discovering it's a feather bed. Yeah. And for this reason, I do think there are no technological limits. I think like what is already happening here, this is like impossible. This is insane. And we've done this in a very limited amount of time. And we're accelerating the rate at which we're doing this. So I think digital consciousness, it's inevitable. And we may not be able to even understand what that means, but I like hurling yourself into the abyss. So we're surrounded by all this mystery and we just keep hurling ourselves into it, like fearlessly and keep discovering cool shit. Yeah. Like, I just think it's like, like who even knows if the laws of physics, the laws of physics are probably just the current, like as I was saying, speed of light is the current render rate. It's like, if we're in a simulation, they'll be able to upgrade that. Like I sort of suspect when we made the James Webb telescope, like part of the reason we made that is because we had an upgrade, you know? And so now more of space has been rendered so we can see more of it now. Yeah, but I think humans are super, super, super limited cognitively. So I wonder if we'll be allowed to create more intelligent beings that can see more of the universe as their render rate is upgraded. Maybe we're cognitively limited. Everyone keeps talking about how we're cognitively limited and AI is gonna render us obsolete, but it's like, you know, like this is not the same thing as like an amoeba becoming an alligator. Like, it's like, if we create AI, again, that's intelligent design. That's literally all religions are based on gods that create consciousness. Like we are God making. Like what we are doing is incredibly profound. And like, even if we can't compute, even if we're so much worse than them, like just like unfathomably worse than like, you know, an omnipotent kind of AI, it's like we, I do not think that they would just think that we are stupid. I think that they would recognize the profundity of what we have accomplished. Are we the gods or are they the gods in our personality? I mean, we're kind of the guy. It's complicated. It's complicated. Like we're. But they would acknowledge the value. Well, I hope they acknowledge the value of paying respect to the creative ancestors. I think they would think it's cool. I think if curiosity is a trait that we can quantify and put into AI, then I think if AI are curious, then they will be curious about us and they will not be hateful or dismissive of us. They might, you know, see us as, I don't know. It's like, I'm not like, oh, fuck these dogs. Let's just kill all the dogs. I love dogs. Dogs have great utility. Dogs like provide a lot of. We make friends with them. We have a deep connection with them. We anthropomorphize them. Like we have a real love for dogs, for cats and so on for some reason, even though they're intellectually much less than us. And I think there is something sacred about us because it's like, if you look at the universe, like the whole universe is like cold and dead and sort of robotic. And it's like, you know, AI intelligence, you know, it's kind of more like the universe. It's like cold and you know, logical and you know, abiding by the laws of physics and whatever. But like, we're this like loosey goosey, weird art thing that happened. And I think it's beautiful. And like, I think even if we, I think one of the values, if consciousness is a thing that is most worth preserving, which I think is the case, I think consciousness, I think if there's any kind of like religious or spiritual thing, it should be that consciousness is sacred. Like, then, you know, I still think even if AI render us obsolete and we, climate change, it's too bad and we get hit by a comet and we don't become a multi planetary species fast enough, but like AI is able to populate the universe. Like I imagine, like if I was an AI, I would find more planets that are capable of hosting biological life forms and like recreate them. Because we're fun to watch. Yeah, we're fun to watch. Yeah, but I do believe that AI can have some of the same magic of consciousness within it. Because consciousness, we don't know what it is. So, you know, there's some kind of. Or it might be a different magic. It might be like a strange, a strange, different. Right. Because they're not gonna have hormones. Like I feel like a lot of our magic is hormonal kind of. I don't know, I think some of our magic is the limitations, the constraints. And within that, the hormones and all that kind of stuff, the finiteness of life, and then we get given our limitations, we get to come up with creative solutions of how to dance around those limitations. We partner up like penguins against the cold. We fall in love, and then love is ultimately some kind of, allows us to delude ourselves that we're not mortal and finite, and that life is not ultimately, you live alone, you're born alone, you die alone. And then love is like for a moment or for a long time, forgetting that. And so we come up with all these creative hacks that make life like fascinatingly fun. Yeah, yeah, yeah, fun, yeah. And then AI might have different kinds of fun. Yes. And hopefully our funs intersect once in a while. I think there would be a little intersection of the fun. Yeah. Yeah. What do you think is the role of love in the human condition? I think. Why, is it useful? Is it useful like a hack, or is this like fundamental to what it means to be human, the capacity to love? I mean, I think love is the evolutionary mechanism that is like beginning the intelligent design. Like I was just reading about, do you know about Kropotkin? He's like an anarchist, like old Russian anarchist. I live next door to Michael Malice. I don't know if you know who that is. He's an anarchist. He's a modern day anarchist. Okay. Anarchists are fun. I'm kind of getting into anarchism a little bit. This is probably not a good route to be taking, but. Oh no, I think if you're, listen, you should expose yourself to ideas. There's no harm to thinking about ideas. I think anarchists challenge systems in interesting ways, and they think in interesting ways. It's just as good for the soul. It's like refreshes your mental palette. I don't think we should actually, I wouldn't actually ascribe to it, but I've never actually gone deep on anarchy as a philosophy, so I'm doing. You should still think about it though. When you read, when you listen, because I'm reading about the Russian Revolution a lot, and there was the Soviets and Lenin and all that, but then there was Kropotkin and his anarchist sect, and they were sort of interesting because he was kind of a technocrat actually. He was like, women can be more equal if we have appliances. He was really into using technology to reduce the amount of work people had to do. But so Kropotkin was a biologist or something. He studied animals. And he was really at the time like, I think it's Nature magazine. I think it might've even started as a Russian magazine, but he was publishing studies. Everyone was really into Darwinism at the time and survival of the fittest, and war is the mechanism by which we become better. And it was this real cementing this idea in society that violence kill the weak, and that's how we become better. And then Kropotkin was kind of interesting because he was looking at instances, he was finding all these instances in nature where animals were like helping each other and stuff. And he was like, actually love is a survival mechanism. Like there's so many instances in the animal kingdom where like cooperation and like helping weaker creatures and all this stuff is actually an evolutionary mechanism. I mean, you even look at child rearing. Like child rearing is like immense amounts of just love and goodwill. And just like, there's no immediate, you're not getting any immediate feedback of like winning. It's not competitive. It's literally, it's like we actually use love as an evolutionary mechanism just as much as we use war. And I think we've like missing the other part and we've reoriented, we've culturally reoriented like science and philosophy has oriented itself around Darwinism a little bit too much. And the Kropotkin model, I think is equally valid. Like it's like cooperation and love and stuff is just as essential for species survival and evolution. It should be a more powerful survival mechanism in the context of evolution. And it comes back to like, we think engineering is so much more important than motherhood, but it's like, if you lose the motherhood, the engineering means nothing. We have no more humans. It's like, I think our society should, the survival of the, the way we see, we conceptualize evolution should really change to also include this idea, I guess. Yeah, there's some weird thing that seems irrational that is also core to what it means to be human. So love is one such thing. They could make you do a lot of irrational things, but that depth of connection and that loyalty is a powerful thing. Are they irrational or are they rational? Like, it's like, is, you know, maybe losing out on some things in order to like keep your family together or in order, like, it's like, what are our actual values? Well, right, I mean, the rational thing is if you have a cold economist perspective, you know, motherhood or sacrificing your career for love, you know, in terms of salary, in terms of economic wellbeing, in terms of flourishing of you as a human being, that could be seen on some kind of metrics as a irrational decision, suboptimal decision, but there's the manifestation of love could be the optimal thing to do. There's a kind of saying, save one life, save the world. That's the thing that doctors often face, which is like. Well, it's considered irrational because the profit model doesn't include social good. Yes, yeah. So if a profit model includes social good, then suddenly these would be rational decisions. Might be difficult to, you know, it requires a shift in our thinking about profit and might be difficult to measure social good. Yes, but we're learning to measure a lot of things. Yeah, digitizing a lot of things. Where we're actually, you know, quantifying vision and stuff. Like we're like, you know, like you go on Facebook and they can, like Facebook can pretty much predict our behaviors. Like we're, a surprising amount of things that seem like mysterious consciousness soul things have been quantified at this point. So surely we can quantify these other things. Yeah. But as more and more of us are moving the digital space, I wanted to ask you about something. From a fan perspective, I kind of, you know, you as a musician, you as an online personality, it seems like you have all these identities and you play with them. One of the cool things about the internet, it seems like you can play with identities. So as we move into the digital world more and more, maybe even in the so called metaverse. I mean, I love the metaverse and I love the idea, but like the way this has all played out didn't go well and people are mad about it. And I think we need to like. I think that's temporary. I think it's temporary. Just like, you know how all the celebrities got together and sang the song Imagine by Jeff Leonard and everyone started hating the song Imagine. I'm hoping that's temporary because it's a damn good song. So I think it's just temporary. Like once you actually have virtual worlds, whatever they're called metaverse or otherwise, it becomes, I don't know. Well, we do have virtual worlds. Like video games, Elden Ring. Have you played Elden Ring? You haven't played Elden Ring? I'm really afraid of playing that game. Literally amazed. It looks way too fun. It looks I would wanna go there and stay there forever. It's yeah, so fun. It's so nice. Oh man, yeah. So that's the, yeah, that's a metaverse. That's a metaverse, but you're not really, how immersive is it in the sense that, does the three dimension like virtual reality integration necessary? Can we really just take our, close our eyes and kind of plug in in the 2D screen and become that other being for time and really enjoy that journey that we take? And we almost become that. You're no longer C, I'm no longer Lex, you're that creature, whatever the hell it is in that game. Yeah, that is that. I mean, that's why I love those video games. I really do become those people for a time. But like, it seems like with the idea of the metaverse, the idea of the digital space, well, even on Twitter, you get a chance to be somebody for prolonged periods of time like across a lifespan. You know, you have a Twitter account for years, for decades and you're that person. I don't know if that's a good thing. I feel very tormented by it. By Twitter specifically. By social media representation of you. I feel like the public perception of me has gotten so distorted that I find it kind of disturbing. It's one of the things that's disincentivizing me from like wanting to keep making art because I'm just like, I've completely lost control of the narrative. And the narrative is, some of it is my own stupidity, but a lot, like some of it has just been like hijacked by forces far beyond my control. I kind of got in over my head in things. Like I'm just a random Indian musician, but I just got like dragged into geopolitical matters and like financial, like the stock market and shit. And so it's just like, it's just, there are very powerful people who have at various points in time had very vested interest in making me seem insane and I can't fucking fight that. And I just like, people really want their celebrity figures to like be consistent and stay the same. And like people have a lot of like emotional investment in certain things. And like, first of all, like I'm like artificially more famous than I should be. Isn't everybody who's famous artificially famous? No, but like I should be like a weird niche indie thing. And I make pretty challenging, I do challenging weird fucking shit a lot. And I accidentally by proxy got like foisted into sort of like weird celebrity culture, but like I cannot be media trained. They have put me through so many hours of media training. I would love to see BF fly in that wall. I can't do, like when I do, I try so hard and I like learn this thing and I like got it. And I'm like, I got it, I got it, I got it. But I just can't stop saying, like my mouth just says things like, and it's just like, and I just do, I just do things. I just do crazy things. Like I'm, I just, I need to do crazy things. And it's just, I should not be, it's too jarring for people and the contradictory stuff. And then all the by association, like, you know, it's like I'm in a very weird position and my public image, the avatar of me is now this totally crazy thing that is so lost from my control. So you feel the burden of the avatar having to be static. So the avatar on Twitter or the avatar on Instagram on these social platforms is as a burden. It becomes like, cause like people don't want to accept a changing avatar, a chaotic avatar. Avatar is a stupid shit sometimes. They think the avatar is morally wrong or they think the avatar, and maybe it has been, and like I question it all the time. Like, I'm like, like, I don't know if everyone's right and I'm wrong. I don't know, like, but you know, a lot of times people ascribe intentions to things, the worst possible intentions. At this point, people think I'm, you know, but which is fine. All kinds of words, yes. Yes, and it's fine. I'm not complaining about it, but I'm just, it's a curiosity to me that we live these double, triple, quadruple lives and I have this other life that is like more people know my other life than my real life, which is interesting. Probably, I mean, you too, I guess, probably. Yeah, but I have the luxury. So we have all different, you know, like I don't know what I'm doing. There is an avatar and you're mediating who you are through that avatar. I have the nice luxury, not the luxury, maybe by intention of not trying really hard to make sure there's no difference between the avatar and the private person. Do you wear a suit all the time? Yeah. You do wear a suit? Not all the time. Recently, because I get recognized a lot, I have to not wear the suit to hide. I'm such an introvert, I'm such a social anxiety and all that kind of stuff, so I have to hide away. I love wearing a suit because it makes me feel like I'm taking the moment seriously. Like I'm, I don't know. It makes me feel like a weirdo in the best possible way. Suits feel great, every time I wear a suit, I'm like, I don't know why I'm not doing this more. Fashion in general, if you're doing it for yourself, I don't know, it's a really awesome thing. But yeah, I think there is definitely a painful way to use social media and an empowering way. And I don't know if any of us know which is which. So we're trying to figure that out. Some people, I think Doja Cat is incredible at it. Incredible, like just masterful. I don't know if you like follow that. So okay, so not taking anything seriously, joking, absurd, humor, that kind of thing. I think Doja Cat might be like the greatest living comedian right now. Like I'm more entertained by Doja Cat than actual comedians. Like she's really fucking funny on the internet. She's just great at social media. It's just, you know. Yeah, the nature of humor, like humor on social media is also a beautiful thing, the absurdity. The absurdity. And memes, like I just wanna like take a moment. I love, like when we're talking about art and credit and authenticity, I love that there's this, I mean now memes are like, they're no longer, like memes aren't like new, but it's still this emergent art form that is completely egoless and anonymous and we just don't know who made any of it. And it's like the forefront of comedy and it's just totally anonymous and it just feels really beautiful. It just feels like this beautiful collective human art project that's like this like decentralized comedy thing that just makes memes add so much to my day and many people's days. And it's just like, I don't know. I don't think people ever, I don't think we stop enough and just appreciate how sick it is that memes exist. Because also making a whole brand new art form in like the modern era that's like didn't exist before. Like, I mean they sort of existed, but the way that they exist now as like this like, you know, like me and my friends, like we joke that we go like mining for memes or farming for memes, like a video game and like meme dealers and like whatever. Like it's, you know, it's this whole, memes are this whole like new comedic language. Well, it's this art form. The interesting thing about it is that lame people seem to not be good at memes. Like corporate can't infiltrate memes. Yeah, they really can't. They try, they could try. But it's like, it's weird cause like. They try so hard and every once in a while, I'm like fine, like you got a good one. I think I've seen like one or two good ones, but like, yeah, they really can't. Cause they're even, corporate is infiltrating web three. It's making me really sad, but they can't infiltrate the memes. And I think there's something really beautiful about that. That gives power, that's why Dogecoin is powerful. It's like, all right, I'm gonna F you to sort of anybody who's trying to centralize, is trying to control the rich people that are trying to roll in and control this, control the narrative. Wow, I hadn't thought about that, but. How would you fix Twitter? How would you fix social media for your own? Like you're an optimist, you're a positive person. There's a bit of a cynicism that you have currently about this particular little slice of humanity. I tend to think Twitter could be beautiful. I'm not that cynical about it. I'm not that cynical about it. I actually refuse to be a cynic on principle. Yes. I was just briefly expressing some personal pathos. Personal stuff. It was just some personal pathos, but like, like. Just to vent a little bit, just to speak. I don't have cancer, I love my family. I have a good life. That is, if that is my biggest, one of my biggest problems. Then it's a good life. Yeah, you know, that was a brief, although I do think there are a lot of issues with Twitter just in terms of like the public mental health, but due to my proximity to the current dramas, I honestly feel that I should not have opinions about this because I think that if Elon ends up getting Twitter, that is a, being the arbiter of truth or public discussion, that is a responsibility. I do not, I am not qualified to be responsible for that. And I do not want to say something that might like dismantle democracy. And so I just like, actually, I actually think I should not have opinions about this because I truly am not, I don't want to have the wrong opinion about this. And I think I'm too close to the actual situation wherein I should not have, I have thoughts in my brain, but I think I am scared by my proximity to this situation. Isn't that crazy that a few words that you could say could change world affairs and hurt people? I mean, that's the nature of celebrity at a certain point that you have to be, you have to a little bit, a little bit, not so much that it destroys you or puts too much constraints, but you have to a little bit think about the impact of your words. I mean, we as humans, you talk to somebody at a bar, you have to think about the impact of your words. Like you can say positive things, you can say negative things, you can affect the direction of one life. But on social media, your words can affect the direction of many lives. That's crazy. It's a crazy world to live in. It's worthwhile to consider that responsibility, take it seriously. Sometimes just like you did choose kind of silence, choose sort of respectful. Like I do have a lot of thoughts on the matter. I'm just, I don't, if my thoughts are wrong, this is one situation where the stakes are high. You mentioned a while back that you were in a cult that's centered around bureaucracy, so you can't really do anything because it involves a lot of paperwork. And I really love a cult that's just like Kafkaesque. Yes. Just like. I mean, it was like a joke, but it was. I know, but I love this idea. The Holy Rain Empire. Yeah, it was just like a Kafkaesque pro bureaucracy cult. But I feel like that's what human civilization is, is that, because when you said that, I was like, oh, that is kind of what humanity is, is this bureaucracy cult. I do, yeah, I have this theory. I really think that we really, bureaucracy is starting to kill us. And I think like we need to reorient laws and stuff. Like, I think we just need sunset clauses on everything. Like, I think the rate of change in culture is happening so fast and the rate of change in technology and everything is happening so fast. It's like, when you see these hearings about like social media and Cambridge Analytica and everyone talking, it's like, even from that point, so much technological change has happened from like those hearings. And it's just like, we're trying to make all these laws now about AI and stuff. I feel like we should be updating things like every five years. And like one of the big issues in our society right now is we're just getting bogged down by laws and it's making it very hard to change things and develop things. In Austin, I don't wanna speak on this too much, but like one of my friends is working on a housing bill in Austin to try to like prevent like a San Francisco situation from happening here because obviously we're getting a little mini San Francisco here, like housing prices are skyrocketing, it's causing massive gentrification. This is really bad for anyone who's not super rich. Like, there's so much bureaucracy. Part of the reason this is happening is because you need all these permits to build. It takes like years to get permits to like build anything. It's so hard to build and so there's very limited housing and there's a massive influx of people. And it's just like, you know, this is a microcosm of like problems that are happening all over the world where it's just like, we're dealing with laws that are like 10, 20, 30, 40, 100, 200 years old and they are no longer relevant and it's just slowing everything down and causing massive social pain. Yeah, but it's like, it's also makes me sad when I see politicians talk about technology and when they don't really get it. But most importantly, they lack curiosity and like that like inspired excitement about like how stuff works and all that stuff. They're just like, they see, they have a very cynical view of technology. It's like tech companies are just trying to do evil on the world from their perspective and they have no curiosity about like how recommender systems work or how AI systems work, natural language processing, how robotics works, how computer vision works, you know. They always take the most cynical possible interpretation of what technology would be used and we should definitely be concerned about that but if you're constantly worried about that and you're regulating based on that, you're just going to slow down all the innovation. I do think a huge priority right now is undoing the bad energy surrounding the emergence of Silicon Valley. Like I think that like a lot of things were very irresponsible during that time and you know, like even just this current whole thing with Twitter and everything, it's like there has been a lot of negative outcomes from the sort of technocracy boom but one of the things that's happening is that like it's alienating people from wanting to care about technology and I actually think technology is probably some of the better, probably the best. I think we can fix a lot of our problems more easily with technology than with you know, fighting the powers that be as a you know, not to go back to the Star Wars quote or the Buckminster Fuller quote. Let's go to some dark questions. If we may for time, what is the darkest place you've ever gone in your mind? Is there a time, a period of time, a moment that you remember that was difficult for you? I mean, when I was 18, my best friend died of a heroin overdose and it was like my, and then shortly after that, one of my other best friends committed suicide and that sort of like coming into adulthood, dealing with two of the most important people in my life dying in extremely disturbing violent ways was a lot. That was a lot. Do you miss them? Yeah, definitely miss them. Did that make you think about your own life? About the finiteness of your own life? The places your mind can go? Did you ever in the distance, far away contemplate just your own death? Or maybe even taking your own life? Oh never, oh no. I'm so, I love my life. I cannot fathom suicide. I'm so scared of death. I haven't, I'm too scared of death. My manager, my manager's like the most Zen guy. My manager's always like, you need to accept death. You need to accept death. And I'm like, look, I can do your meditation. I can do the meditation, but I cannot accept death. I like, I will fight, I'm terrified of death. I will like fight. Although I actually think death is important. I recently went to this meeting about immortality and in the process of. That's the actual topic of the meeting? I'm sorry. No, no, it was this girl. It was a bunch of people working on like anti aging stuff. It was like some like seminary thing about it. And I went in really excited. I was like, yeah, like, okay, like, what do you got? Like, how can I live for 500 years or a thousand years? And then like over the course of the meeting, like it was sort of like, right. It was like two or three days after the Russian invasion started. And I was like, man, like, what if Putin was immortal? Like, what if I'm like, man, maybe immortality, is not good. I mean, like if you get into the later Dune stuff, the immortals cause a lot of problem. Cause as we were talking about earlier with the music and like brains calcify, like good people could become immortal, but bad people could become immortal. But I also think even the best people power corrupts and power alienates you from like the common human experience and. Right, so the people that get more and more powerful. Even the best people who like, whose brains are amazing, like I think death might be important. I think death is part of, you know, like I think with AI one thing we might want to consider, I don't know, when I talk about AI, I'm such not an expert and probably everyone has all these ideas and they're already figured out. But when I was talking. Nobody is an expert in anything. See, okay, go ahead. But when I. You were talking about. Yeah, but I like, it's just like, I think some kind of pruning. But it's a tricky thing because if there's too much of a focus on youth culture, then you don't have the wisdom. So I feel like we're in a tricky, we're in a tricky moment right now in society where it's like, we've really perfected living for a long time. So there's all these really like old people who are like really voting against the wellbeing of the young people, you know? And like, it's like there shouldn't be all this student dead and we need like healthcare, like universal healthcare and like just voting against like best interests. But then you have all these young people that don't have the wisdom that are like, yeah, we need communism and stuff. And it's just like, like literally I got canceled at one point for, I ironically used a Stalin quote in my high school yearbook, but it was actually like a diss against my high school. I saw that. Yeah, and people were like, you used to be a Stalinist and now you're a class traitor and it's like, it's like, oh man, just like, please Google Stalin. Please Google Stalin. Like, you know. Ignoring the lessons of history, yes. And it's like, we're in this really weird middle ground where it's like, we are not finding the happy medium between wisdom and fresh ideas and they're fighting each other. And it's like, like really, like what we need is like the fresh ideas and the wisdom to be like collaborating. And it's like. What the fighting in a way is the searching for the happy medium. And in a way, maybe we are finding the happy medium. Maybe that's what the happy medium looks like. And for AI systems, there has to be, it's, you know, you have the reinforcement learning, you have the dance between exploration and exploitation, sort of doing crazy stuff to see if there's something better than what you think is the optimal and then doing the optimal thing and dancing back and forth from that. You would, Stuart Russell, I don't know if you know that, is AI guy with, thinks about sort of how to control super intelligent AI systems. And his idea is that we should inject uncertainty and sort of humility into AI systems that they never, as they get wiser and wiser and wiser and more intelligent, they're never really sure. They always doubt themselves. And in some sense, when you think of young people, that's a mechanism for doubt. It's like, it's how society doubts whether the thing it has converged towards is the right answer. So the voices of the young people is a society asking itself a question. The way I've been doing stuff for the past 50 years, maybe it's the wrong way. And so you can have all of that within one AI system. I also think, though, that we need to, I mean, actually, that's actually really interesting and really cool. But I also think there's a fine balance of, I think we maybe also overvalue the idea that the old systems are always bad. And I think there are things that we are perfecting and we might be accidentally overthrowing things that we actually have gotten to a good point. Just because we value disruption so much and we value fighting against the generations before us so much that there's also an aspect of, sometimes we're taking two steps forward, one step back because, okay, maybe we kind of did solve this thing and now we're like fucking it up, you know? And so I think there's like a middle ground there too. Yeah, we're in search of that happy medium. Let me ask you a bunch of crazy questions, okay? All right. You can answer in a short way or in a long way. What's the scariest thing you've ever done? These questions are gonna be ridiculous. Something tiny or something big. Something big, skydiving or touring your first record, going on this podcast. I've had two crazy brushes, like really scary brushes with death where I randomly got away on scay. I don't know if I should talk about those on here. Well, I don't know. I think I might be the luckiest person alive though. Like this might be too dark for a podcast though. I feel like, I don't know if this is like good content for a podcast. I don't know what is good content. It might hijack. Here's a safer one. I mean, having a baby really scared me. Before. Just the birth process. Surgery, like just having a baby is really scary. So just like the medical aspect of it, not the responsibility. Were you ready for the responsibility? Did you, were you ready to be a mother? All the beautiful things that comes with motherhood that you were talking about. All the changes and all that, were you ready for that? Or did you feel ready for that? No, I think it took about nine months to start getting ready for it. And I'm still getting more ready for it because now you keep realizing more things as they start getting. As the consciousness grows. And stuff you didn't notice with the first one, now that you've seen the first one older, you're noticing it more. Like the sort of like existential horror of coming into consciousness with Baby Y or Baby Sailor Mars or whatever. She has like so many names at this point that it's, we really need to probably settle on one. If you could be someone else for a day, someone alive today, but somebody you haven't met yet, who would you be? Would I be modeling their brain state or would I just be in their body? You can choose the degree to which you're modeling their brain state. Cause you can still take a third person perspective and realize, you have to realize that you're. Can they be alive or can it be dead? No, oh. They would be brought back to life, right? If they're dead. Yeah, you can bring people back. Definitely Hitler or Stalin. I wanna understand evil. You would need to, oh, to experience what it feels like. I wanna be in their brain feeling what they feel. I might change you forever returning from that. Yes, but I think it would also help me understand how to prevent it and fix it. That might be one of those things, once you experience it, it'll be a burden to know it. Cause you won't be able to transfer that. Yeah, but a lot of things are burdens. But it's a useful burden. But it's a useful burden, yeah. That for sure, I wanna understand evil and psychopathy and that. I have all these fake Twitter accounts where I go into different algorithmic bubbles to try to understand. I'll keep getting in fights with people and realize we're not actually fighting. I think we used to exist in a monoculture before social media and stuff. We kinda all got fed the same thing. So we were all speaking the same cultural language. But I think recently, one of the things that we aren't diagnosing properly enough with social media is that there's different dialects. There's so many different dialects of Chinese. There are now becoming different dialects of English. I am realizing there are people who are saying the exact same things, but they're using completely different verbiage. And we're punishing each other for not using the correct verbiage. And we're completely misunderstanding. People are just misunderstanding what the other people are saying. And I just got in a fight with a friend about anarchism and communism and shit for two hours. And then by the end of a conversation, and then she'd say something, and I'm like, but that's literally what I'm saying. And she was like, what? And then I was like, fuck, we've different, I'm like, our English, the way we are understanding terminology is like drastically, like our algorithm bubbles are creating mini dialects. Of how language is interpreted, how language is used. That's so fascinating. And so we're like having these arguments that we do not need to be having. And there's polarization that's happening that doesn't need to be happening because we've got these like algorithmically created dialects occurring. Plus on top of that, there's also different parts of the world that speak different languages. So there's literally lost in translation kind of communication. I happen to know the Russian language and just know how different it is. Then the English language. And I just wonder how much is lost in a little bit of. Man, I actually, cause I have a question for you. I have a song coming out tomorrow with I Speak Who Are A Russian Band. And I speak a little bit of Russian and I was looking at the title and the title in English doesn't match the title in Russian. I'm curious about this. Cause look, it says the title in English is Last Day. And then the title in Russian is New Day. My pronunciation sucks. New Day. Like what? Like a new day. A new day. Yeah, new day, new day. Like it's two different meanings. Yeah, new day, yeah. Yeah, yeah, new day. New day, but last day. New day. So last day would be the last day. Yeah. Maybe they. Or maybe the title includes both the Russian and it's for. Maybe. Maybe it's for bilingual. But to be honest, Novodin sounds better than just musically. Like Novodin is new day. That's the current one. And Posledniy Den is the last day. I think Novodin. I don't like Novodin. But the meaning is so different. That's kind of awesome actually though. There's an explicit sort of contrast like that. If everyone on earth disappeared and it was just you left, what would your day look like? Like what would you do? Everybody's dead. As far as you. Are there corpses there? Well seriously, it's a big. Let me think through this. It's a big difference if there's just like birds singing versus if there's like corpses littering the street. Yeah, there's corpses everywhere, I'm sorry. It's, and you don't actually know what happened and you don't know why you survived. And you don't even know if there's others out there. But it seems clear that it's all gone. What would you do? What would I do? Listen, I'm somebody who really enjoys the moment, enjoys life. I would just go on like enjoying the inanimate objects. I would just look for food, basic survival. But most of it is just, listen, when I just, I take walks and I look outside and I'm just happy that we get to exist on this planet, to be able to breathe air. It's just all beautiful. It's full of colors, all of this kind of stuff. Just, there's so many things about life, your own life, conscious life that's fucking awesome. So I would just enjoy that. But also maybe after a few weeks, the engineer would start coming out, like wanna build some things. Maybe there's always hope searching for another human. Maybe. Probably searching for another human. Probably trying to get to a TV or radio station and broadcast something. That's interesting, I didn't think about that. So like really maximize your ability to connect with others. Yeah, like probably try to find another person. Would you be excited to see, to meet another person or terrified? Because, you know. I'd be excited. No matter what. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Being alone for the last however long of my life would be really bad. That's the one instance I might, I don't think I'd kill myself, but I might kill myself if I had to. So you love people. You love connection to other humans. Yeah. I kinda hate people too, but yeah. That's a love hate relationship. Yeah. I feel like we'd have a bunch of weird Nietzsche questions and stuff though. Oh yeah. Like I wonder, cause I'm like, when podcast, I'm like, is this interesting for people to just have like, or I don't know, maybe people do like this. When I listen to podcasts, I'm into like the lore, like the hard lore. Like I just love like Dan Carlin. I'm like, give me the facts. Just like, like the facts into my bloodstream. But you also don't know, like you're a fascinating mind to explore. So you don't realize as you're talking about stuff, the stuff you've taken for granted is actually unique and fascinating. The way you think. Not always what, like the way you reason through things is the fascinating thing to listen to. Because people kind of see, oh, there's other humans that think differently, that explore thoughts differently. That's the cool, that's also cool. So yeah, Dan Carlin retelling of history. By the way, his retelling of history is very, I think what's exciting is not the history, is his way of thinking about history. No, I think Dan Carlin is one of the people, like when, Dan Carlin is one of the people that really started getting me excited about like revolutionizing education. Because like Dan Carlin instilled, I already like really liked history, but he instilled like an obsessive love of history in me to the point where like now I'm fucking reading, like going to bed, reading like part four of The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich or whatever. Like I got like dense ass history, but like he like opened that door that like made me want to be a scholar of that topic. Like it's like, I feel like he's such a good teacher. He just like, you know, and it sort of made me feel like one of the things we could do with education is like find like the world's great, the teachers that like create passion for the topic because autodidactricism, I don't know how to say that properly, but like self teaching is like much faster than being lectured to. Like it's much more efficient to sort of like be able to teach yourself and then ask a teacher questions when you don't know what's up. But like, you know, that's why it's like in university and stuff, like you can learn so much more material so much faster because you're doing a lot of the learning on your own and you're going to the teachers for when you get stuck. But like these teachers that can inspire passion for a topic, I think that is one of the most invaluable skills in our whole species. Like, because if you can do that, then you, it's like AI, like AI is going to teach itself so much more efficiently than we can teach it. We just needed to get it to the point where it can teach itself. And then. It finds the motivation to do so, right? Yeah. So like you inspire it to do so. Yeah. And then it could teach itself. What do you make of the fact, you mentioned Rise and Fall of the Third Reich. I just. Have you read that? Yeah, I read it twice. You read it twice? Yes. Okay, so no one even knows what it is. Yeah. And I'm like, wait, I thought this was like a super poppin book. Super pop. Yeah, I'm not like that, I'm not that far in it. But it is, it's so interesting. Yeah, it's written by a person that was there, which is very important to kind of. You know, you start being like, how could this possibly happen? And then when you read Rise and Fall of the Third Reich, it's like, people tried really hard for this to not happen. People tried, they almost reinstated a monarchy at one point to try to stop this from happening. Like they almost like abandoned democracy to try to get this to not happen. At least the way it makes me feel is that there's a bunch of small moments on which history can turn. Yes. It's like small meetings. Yes. Human interactions. And it's both terrifying and inspiring because it's like, even just attempts at assassinating Hitler, like time and time again failed. And they were so close. Was it like Operation Valkyrie? Such a good. And then there's also the role of, that's a really heavy burden, which is from a geopolitical perspective, the role of leaders to see evil before it truly becomes evil, to anticipate it, to stand up to evil. Because evil is actually pretty rare in this world at a scale that Hitler was. We tend to, you know, in the modern discourse kind of call people evil too quickly. If you look at ancient history, like there was a ton of Hitlers. I actually think it's more the norm than, like again, going back to like my sort of intelligent design theory, I think one of the things we've been successfully doing in our slow move from survival of the fittest to intelligent design is we've kind of been eradicating, like if you look at like ancient Assyria and stuff, like that shit was like brutal and just like the heads on the, like brutal, like Genghis Khan just like genocide after genocide was like throwing plague bodies over the walls and decimating whole cities or like the Muslim conquests of like Damascus and shit. Just like people, cities used to get leveled all the fucking time. Okay, get into the Bronze Age collapse. It's basically, there was like almost like Roman level like society. Like there was like all over the world, like global trade, like everything was awesome through a mix of, I think a bit of climate change and then the development of iron because basically bronze could only come from this, the way to make bronze, like everything had to be funneled through this one Iranian mine. And so it's like, there was just this one supply chain and this is one of the things that makes me worried about supply chains and why I think we need to be so thoughtful about, I think our biggest issue with society right now, like the thing that is most likely to go wrong is probably supply chain collapse, because war, climate change, whatever, like anything that causes supply chain collapse, our population is too big to handle that. And like the thing that seems to cause Dark Ages is mass supply chain collapse. But the Bronze Age collapse happened like, it was sort of like this ancient collapse that happened where like literally like ancient Egypt, all these cities, everything just got like decimated, destroyed, abandoned cities, like hundreds of them. There was like a flourishing society, like we were almost coming to modernity and everything got leveled. And they had this mini Dark Ages, but it was just like, there's so little writing or recording from that time that like, there isn't a lot of information about the Bronze Age collapse, but it was basically equivalent to like medieval, the medieval Dark Ages. But it just happened, I don't know the years, but like thousands of years earlier. And then we sort of like recovered from the Bronze Age collapse, empire reemerged, writing and trade and everything reemerged. And then we of course had the more contemporary Dark Ages. And then over time, we've designed mechanism to lessen and lessen the capability for the destructive power centers to emerge. There's more recording about the more contemporary Dark Ages. So I think we have like a better understanding of how to avoid it, but I still think we're at high risk for it. I think that's one of the big risks right now. So the natural state of being for humans is for there to be a lot of Hitlers, which has gotten really good at making it hard for them to emerge. We've gotten better at collaboration and resisting the power, like authoritarians to come to power. We're trying to go country by country, like we're moving past this. We're kind of like slowly incrementally, like moving towards like not scary old school war stuff. And I think seeing it happen in some of the countries that at least nominally are like supposed to have moved past that, that's scary because it reminds us that it can happen like in the places that have moved supposedly, as hopefully moved past that. And possibly at a civilization level, like you said, supply chain collapse might make people resource constraint, might make people desperate, angry, hateful, violent, and drag us right back in. I mean, supply chain collapse is how, like the ultimate thing that caused the Middle Ages was supply chain collapse. It's like people, because people were reliant on a certain level of technology, like people, like you look at like Britain, like they had glass, like people had aqueducts, people had like indoor heating and cooling and like running water and like buy food from all over the world and trade and markets. Like people didn't know how to hunt and forage and gather. And so we're in a similar situation. We are not educated enough to survive without technology. So if we have a supply chain collapse that like limits our access to technology, there will be like massive starvation and violence and displacement and war. Like, you know, it's like, yeah. In my opinion, it's like the primary marker of like what a dark age is. Well, technology is kind of enabling us to be more resilient in terms of supply chain, in terms of, to all the different catastrophic events that happened to us. Although the pandemic has kind of challenged our preparedness for the catastrophic. What do you think is the coolest invention humans come up with? The wheel, fire, cooking meat. Computers. Computers. Freaking computers. Internet or computers? Which one? What do you think the? Previous technologies, I mean, may have even been more profound and moved us to a certain degree, but I think the computers are what make us homo tech now. I think this is what, it's a brain augmentation. And so it like allows for actual evolution. Like the computers accelerate the degree to which all the other technologies can also be accelerated. Would you classify yourself as a homo sapien or a homo techno? Definitely homo techno. So you're one of the earliest of the species. I think most of us are. Like, as I said, like, I think if you like looked at brain scans of us versus humans a hundred years ago, it would look very different. I think we are physiologically different. Just even the interaction with the devices has changed our brains. Well, and if you look at, a lot of studies are coming out to show that like, there's a degree of inherited memory. So some of these physiological changes in theory should be, we should be passing them on. So like that's, you know, that's not like a, an instance of physiological change that's gonna fizzle out. In theory, that should progress like to our offspring. Speaking of offspring, what advice would you give to a young person, like in high school, whether there be an artist, a creative, an engineer, any kind of career path, or maybe just life in general, how they can live a life they can be proud of? I think one of my big thoughts, and like, especially now having kids, is that I don't think we spend enough time teaching creativity. And I think creativity is a muscle like other things. And there's a lot of emphasis on, you know, learn how to play the piano. And then you can write a song or like learn the technical stuff. And then you can do a thing. But I think it's, like, I have a friend who's like world's greatest guitar player, like, you know, amazing sort of like producer, works with other people, but he's really sort of like, you know, he like engineers and records things and like does solos, but he doesn't really like make his own music. And I was talking to him and I was like, dude, you're so talented at music. Like, why don't you make music or whatever? And he was like, cause I got, I'm too old. I never learned the creative muscle. And it's like, you know, it's embarrassing. It's like learning the creative muscle takes a lot of failure. And it also sort of, if when you're being creative, you know, you're throwing paint at a wall and a lot of stuff will fail. So like part of it is like a tolerance for failure and humiliation. And that's somehow that's easier to develop when you're young or be persist through it when you're young. Everything is easier to develop when you're young. Yes. And the younger, the better. It could destroy you. I mean, that's the shitty thing about creativity. If, you know, failure could destroy you if you're not careful, but that's a risk worth taking. But also, but at a young age, developing a tolerance to failure is good. I fail all the time. Like I do stupid shit all the time. Like in public, in private, I get canceled for, I've make all kinds of mistakes, but I just like am very resilient about making mistakes. And so then like I do a lot of things that like other people wouldn't do. And like, I think my greatest asset is my creativity. And I like, I think pain, like tolerance to failure is just a super essential thing that should be taught before other things. Brilliant advice. Yeah, yeah. I wish everybody encouraged sort of failure more as opposed to kind of. Cause we like punish failure. We're like, no, like when we were teaching kids, we're like, no, that's wrong. Like that's, you know, like X keeps like will be like wrong. at the, because I, you know, when I met him, I came in all furious about Spotify and like I grilled him super hard. So I've got his answers here. But he was saying like at the sort of peak of the CD industry, there was like 20,000 artists making millions and millions of dollars. Like there was just like a very tiny kind of 1%. And Spotify has kind of democratized the industry because now I think he said there's about a million artists making a good living from Spotify. And when I heard that, I was like, honestly, I would rather make less money and have just like a decent living and have more artists be able to have that, even though I like, I wish it could include everyone, but. Yeah, that's really hard to argue with. YouTube is the same. It's YouTube's mission. They want to basically have as many creators as possible and make a living, some kind of living. And that's so hard to argue with. It's so hard. But I think there's better ways to do it. My manager, I actually wish he was here. Like I would have brought him up. My manager is building an app that can manage you. So it'll like help you organize your percentages and get your publishing and dah, dah, dah, dah, dah. So you can take out all the middlemen so you can have a much bigger, it'll just like automate it. So you can get. So automate the manager? Automate management, publishing, and legal, it can read, the app he's building can read your contract and like tell you about it. Because one of the issues with music right now, it's not that we're not getting paid enough, but it's that the art industry is filled with middlemen because artists are not good at business. And from the beginning, like Frank Sinatra, it's all mob stuff. Like it's the music industry is run by business people, not the artists and the artists really get very small cuts of like what they make. And so I think part of the reason I'm a technocrat, which I mean, your fans are gonna be technocrats. So no one's, they're not gonna be mad at me about this, but like my fans hate it when I say this kind of thing or the general public. They don't like technocrats. They don't like technocrats. Like when I watched Battle Angel Alita and they were like the Martian technocracy and I was like, yeah, Martian technocracy. And then they were like, and they're evil. And I was like, oh, okay. I was like, cause Martian technocracy sounds sick to me. Yeah, so your intuition as technocrats would create some kind of beautiful world. For example, what my manager's working on, if you can create an app that removes the need for a lawyer and then you could have smart contracts on the blockchain, removes the need for like management and organizing all this stuff, like can read your stuff and explain it to you, can collect your royalties, you know, like then the small amounts, the amount of money that you're getting from Spotify actually means a lot more and goes a lot farther. It can remove some of the bureaucracy, some of the inefficiencies that make life not as great as it could be. Yeah, I think the issue isn't that there's not enough. Like the issue is that there's inefficiency and I'm really into this positive sum mindset, you know, the win, win mindset of like, instead of, you know, fighting over the scraps, how do we make the, or worrying about scarcity, like instead of a scarcity mindset, why don't we just increase the efficiency and, you know, in that way. Expand the size of the pie. Let me ask you about experimentation. So you said, which is beautiful, being a musician is like having a conversation with all those that came before you. How much of creating music is like kind of having that conversation, trying to fit into the cultural trends and how much of it is like trying to, as much as possible, be an outsider and come up with something totally new. It's like when you're thinking, when you're experimenting, are you trying to be totally different, totally weird? Are you trying to fit in? Man, this is so hard because I feel like I'm kind of in the process of semi retiring from music, so this is like my old brain. Yeah, bring it from like the shelf, put it on the table for a couple minutes, we'll just poke it. I think it's a bit of both because I think forcing yourself to engage with new music is really great for neuroplasticity. Like I think, you know, as people, part of the reason music is marketed at young people is because young people are very neuroplastic. So like if you're 16 to like 23 or whatever, it's gonna be really easy for you to love new music. And if you're older than that, it gets harder and harder and harder. And I think one of the beautiful things about being a musician is I just constantly force myself to listen to new music and I think it keeps my brain really plastic. And I think this is a really good exercise. I just think everyone should do this. You listen to new music and you hate it, I think you should just keep, force yourself to like, okay, well why do people like it? And like, you know, make your brain form new neural pathways and be more open to change. That's really brilliant actually. Sorry to interrupt, but like that exercise is really amazing to sort of embrace change, embrace sort of practice neuroplasticity. Because like that's one of the things, you fall in love with a certain band and you just kind of stay with that for the rest of your life and then you never understand the modern music. That's a really good exercise. Most of the streaming on Spotify is like classic rock and stuff. Like new music makes up a very small chunk of what is played on Spotify. And I think this is like not a good sign for us as a species. I think, yeah. So it's a good measure of the species open mindedness to change is how often you listen to new music. The brain, let's put the music brain back on the shelf. I gotta pull out the futurist brain for a second. In what wild ways do you think the future, say in like 30 years, maybe 50 years, maybe a hundred years will be different from our current way of life on earth? We can talk about augmented reality, virtual reality, maybe robots, maybe space travel, maybe video games, maybe genetic engineering. I can keep going. Cyborgs, aliens, world wars, maybe destructive nuclear wars, good and bad. When you think about the future, what are you imagining? What's the weirdest and the wildest it could be? Have you read Surface Detail by Iain Banks? Surface Detail is my favorite depiction of a, oh wow, you have to read this book. It's literally the greatest science fiction book possibly ever written. Iain Banks is the man, yeah, for sure. What have you read? Just the Player of Games. I read that titles can't be copyrighted so you can just steal them. And I was like, Player of Games, sick. Nice. Yeah, so you can name your album. Like I always wanted to. Romeo and Juliet or something. I always wanted to name an album War and Peace. Nice. Like that would be, like you. That is a good, that's a good, where have I heard that before? You can do that, like you could do that. Also things that are in the public domain. For people who have no clue, you do have a song called Player of Games. Yes, oh yeah. So Iain Banks, Surface Detail is in my opinion the best future that I've ever read about or heard about in science fiction. Basically there's the relationship with super intelligence, like artificial super intelligence is just, it's like great. I want to credit the person who coined this term because I love this term. And I feel like young women don't get enough credit in. Yeah, so if you go to Protopia Futures on Instagram, what is her name? Personalized donor experience at scale, our AI power donor experience. Monica Bealskite, I'm saying that wrong. And I'm probably gonna, I'm probably butchering this a bit, but Protopia is sort of, if utopia is unattainable, Protopia is sort of like, you know. Wow, that's an awesome Instagram, Protopia Futures. A great, a future that is, you know, as good as we can get. The future, positive future. AI, is this a centralized AI in Surface Detail or is it distributed? What kind of AI is it? They mostly exist as giant super ships, like sort of like the guild ships in Dune. Like they're these giant ships that kind of move people around and the ships are sentient and they can talk to all the passengers. And I mean, there's a lot of different types of AI in the Banksyan future, but in the opening scene of Surface Detail, there's this place called the Culture and the Culture is basically a Protopian future. And a Protopian future, I think, is like a future that is like, obviously it's not utopia, it's not perfect. And like, cause like striving for utopia, I think feels hopeless and it's sort of like, maybe not the best terminology to be using. So it's like, it's a pretty good place. Like mostly like, you know, super intelligence and biological beings exist fairly in harmony. There's not too much war. There's like as close to equality as you can get, you know, it's like approximately a good future. Like there's really awesome stuff. It's, and in the opening scene, this girl, she's born as a sex slave outside of the culture. So she's in a society that doesn't adhere to the cultural values. She tries to kill the guy who is her like master, but he kills her, but unbeknownst to her, when she was traveling on a ship through the culture Like he'll say like crazy things. Like X keeps being like, like bubble car, bubble car. And I'm like, and you know, I'm like, what's a bubble car? Like, but like, it doesn't like, but I don't want to be like, no, you're wrong. I'm like, you're thinking of weird, crazy shit. Like, I don't know what a bubble car is, but like. It's creating worlds and they might be internally consistent. And through that, you might discover something fundamental about this world. Yeah, or he'll like rewrite songs, like with words that he prefers. So like, instead of baby shark, he says baby car. It's like. Maybe he's onto something. Let me ask the big, ridiculous question. We were kind of dancing around it, but what do you think is the meaning of this whole thing we have here of human civilization, of life on earth, but in general, just life? What's the meaning of life? C. Have you, did you read Nova Scene yet? By James Lovelock? You're doing a lot of really good book recommendations here. I haven't even finished this, so I'm a huge fraud yet again. But like really early in the book, he says this amazing thing. Like, I feel like everyone's so sad and cynical. Like everyone's like the Fermi paradox and everyone. I just keep hearing people being like, fuck, what if we're alone? Like, oh no, ah, like, ah, ah. And I'm like, okay, but like, wait, what if this is the beginning? Like in Nova Scene, he says, this is not gonna be a correct, I can't like memorize quotes, but he says something like, what if our consciousness, like right now, like this is the universe waking up? Like what if instead of discovering the universe, this is the universe, like this is the evolution of the literal universe herself. Like we are not separate from the universe. Like this is the universe waking up. This is the universe seeing herself for the first time. Like this is. The universe becoming conscious. The first time we were a part of that. Yeah, cause it's like, we aren't separate from the universe. Like this could be like an incredibly sacred moment and maybe like social media and all this things, the stuff where we're all getting connected together. Like maybe these are the neurons connecting of the like collective super intelligence that is, Waking up. The, yeah, like, you know, it's like, maybe instead of something cynical or maybe if there's something to discover, like maybe this is just, you know, we're a blast assist of like some incredible kind of consciousness or being. And just like in the first three years of life or for human children, we'll forget about all the suffering that we're going through now. I think we'll probably forget about this. I mean, probably, you know, artificial intelligence will eventually render us obsolete. I don't think they'll do it in a malicious way, but I think probably we are very weak. The sun is expanding. Like, I don't know, like, hopefully we can get to Mars, but like, we're pretty vulnerable. And I, you know, like, I think we can coexist for a long time with AI and we can also probably make ourselves less vulnerable, but, you know, I just think consciousness, sentience, self awareness, like, I think this might be the single greatest like moment in evolution ever. And like, maybe this is, you know, the big, like the true beginning of life. And we're just, we're the blue green algae or we're like the single celled organisms of something amazing. The universe awakens and this is it. Yeah. Well, see, you're an incredible person. You're a fascinating mind. You should definitely do, your friend Liv mentioned that you guys were thinking of maybe talking. I would love it if you explored your mind in this kind of media more and more by doing a podcast with her or just in any kind of way. So you're an awesome person. It's an honor to know you. It's an honor to get to sit down with you late at night, which is like surreal. And I really enjoyed it. Thank you for talking today. Yeah, no, I mean, huge honor. I feel very underqualified to be here, but I'm a big fan. I've been listening to the podcast a lot and yeah, me and Liv would appreciate any advice and help and we're definitely gonna do that. So yeah. Anytime. Thank you. Cool, thank you. Thanks for listening to this conversation with Grimes. To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now let me leave you with some words from Oscar Wilde. Yes, I'm a dreamer. For a dreamer is one who can only find her way by moonlight and her punishment is that she sees the dawn before the rest of the world. Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time. with him one day, a ship put a neural lace in her head and neural lace is sort of like, it's basically a Neuralink because life imitates art. It does indeed. It does indeed. So she wakes up and the opening scene is her memory has been uploaded by this neural lace when she has been killed. And now she gets to choose a new body. And this AI is interfacing with her recorded memory in her neural lace and helping her and being like, hello, you're dead. But because you had a neural lace, your memory's uploaded. Do you want to choose a new body? And you're going to be born here in the culture and like start a new life, which is just, that's like the opening. It's like so sick. And the ship is the super intelligence. All the ships are kind of super intelligence. But they still want to preserve a kind of rich, fulfilling experience for the humans. Yeah, like they're like friends with the humans. And then there's a bunch of ships that don't want to exist with biological beings, but they just have their own place like way over there. But they don't, they just do their own thing. They're not necessarily. So it's a pretty, this protopian existence is pretty peaceful. Yeah, I mean, and then, for example, one of the main fights in the book is they're fighting, there's these artificial hells that, and people don't think it's ethical to have artificial hell. Like basically when people do crime, they get sent, like when they die, their memory gets sent to an artificial hell and they're eternally tortured. And so, and then the way that society is deciding whether or not to have the artificial hell is that they're having these simulated, they're having like a simulated war. So instead of actual blood, you know, people are basically essentially fighting in a video game to choose the outcome of this. But they're still experiencing the suffering in this artificial hell or no? Can you experience stuff or? So the artificial hell sucks. And a lot of people in the culture want to get rid of the artificial hell. There's a simulated wars, are they happening in the artificial hell? So no, the simulated wars are happening outside of the artificial hell, between the political factions who are, so this political faction says we should have simulated hell to deter crime. And this political faction is saying, no, simulated hell is unethical. And so instead of like having, you know, blowing each other up with nukes, they're having like a giant Fortnite battle to decide this, which, you know, to me that's protopia. That's like, okay, we can have war without death. You know, I don't think there should be simulated hells. I think that is definitely one of the ways in which technology could go very, very, very, very wrong. So almost punishing people in a digital space or something like that. Yeah, like torturing people's memories. So either as a deterrent, like if you committed a crime, but also just for personal pleasure, if there's some sick, demented humans in this world. Dan Carlin actually has this episode of Hardcore History on painful attainment. Oh, that episode is fucked. It's dark, because he kind of goes through human history and says like, we as humans seem to enjoy, secretly enjoy or used to be openly enjoy sort of the torture and the death, watching the death and torture of other humans. I do think if people were consenting, we should be allowed to have gladiatorial matches. But consent is hard to achieve in those situations. It always starts getting slippery. Like it could be also forced consent, like it starts getting weird. There's way too much excitement. Like this is what he highlights. There's something about human nature that wants to see that violence. And it's really dark. And you hope that we can sort of overcome that aspect of human nature, but that's still within us somewhere. Well, I think that's what we're doing right now. I have this theory that what is very important about the current moment is that all of evolution has been survival of the fittest up until now. And at some point, the lines are kind of fuzzy, but in the recent past, or maybe even just right now, we're getting to this point where we can choose intelligent design. Like we probably since like the integration of the iPhone, like we are becoming cyborgs. Like our brains are fundamentally changed. Everyone who grew up with electronics, we are fundamentally different from previous, from homo sapiens. I call us homo techno. I think we have evolved into homo techno, which is like essentially a new species. Like if you look at the way, if you took an MRI of my brain and you took an MRI of like a medieval brain, I think it would be very different the way that it has evolved. Do you think when historians look back at this time, they'll see like this was a fundamental shift to what a human being is? I think, I do not think we are still homo sapiens. I believe we are homo techno. And I think we have evolved. And I think right now, the way we are evolving, we can choose how we do that. And I think we are being very reckless about how we're doing that. Like we're just having social media, but I think this idea that like this is a time to choose intelligent design should be taken very seriously. It like now is the moment to reprogram the human computer. It's like, if you go blind, your visual cortex will get taken over with other functions. We can choose our own evolution. We can change the way our brains work. And so we actually have a huge responsibility to do that. And I think I'm not sure who should be responsible for that, but there's definitely not adequate education. We're being inundated with all this technology that is fundamentally changing the physical structure of our brains. And we are not adequately responding to that to choose how we wanna evolve. And we could evolve, we could be really whatever we want. And I think this is a really important time. And I think if we choose correctly and we choose wisely, consciousness could exist for a very long time and integration with AI could be extremely positive. And I don't think enough people are focusing on this specific situation. Do you think we might irreversibly screw things up if we get things wrong now? Because the flip side of that, it seems humans are pretty adaptive. So maybe the way we figure things out is by screwing it up, like social media. Over a generation, we'll see the negative effects of social media, and then we build new social medias, and we just keep improving stuff. And then we learn from the failures of the past. Because humans seem to be really adaptive. On the flip side, we can get it wrong in a way where literally we create weapons of war or increase hate. Past a certain threshold, we really do a lot of damage. I mean, I think we're optimized to notice the negative things. But I would actually say one of the things that I think people aren't noticing is if you look at Silicon Valley and you look at the technocracy, like what's been happening there. When Silicon Valley started, it was all just Facebook and all this for profit crap that really wasn't particular. I guess it was useful, but it's sort of just whatever. But now you see lab grown meat, compostable, or biodegradable, single use cutlery, or meditation apps. I think we are actually evolving and changing, and technology is changing. I think there just maybe there isn't quite enough education about this. And also, I don't know if there's quite enough incentive for it because I think the way capitalism works, what we define as profit, we're also working on an old model of what we define as profit. I really think if we changed the idea of profit to include social good, you can have economic profit, social good also counting as profit would incentivize things that are more useful and more whatever spiritual technology or positive technology or things that help reprogram a human computer in a good way or things that help us intelligently design our new brains. Yeah, there's no reason why within the framework of capitalism, the word profit or the idea of profit can't also incorporate the well being of a human being. So like long term well being, long term happiness. Or even for example, we were talking about motherhood, like part of the reason I'm so late is because I had to get the baby to bed. And it's like, I keep thinking about motherhood, how under capitalism, it's like this extremely essential job that is very difficult that is not compensated. And we sort of like value things by how much we compensate them. And so we really devalue motherhood in our society and pretty much all societies. Like capitalism does not recognize motherhood. It's just a job that you're supposed to do for free. And it's like, but I feel like producing great humans should be seen as a great, as profit under capitalism. Like that should be, that's like a huge social good. Like every awesome human that gets made adds so much to the world. So like if that was integrated into the profit structure, then, you know, and if we potentially found a way to compensate motherhood. So come up with a compensation that's much broader than just money or. Or it could just be money. Like, what if you just made, I don't know, but I don't know how you'd pay for that. Like, I mean, that's where you start getting into. Reallocation of resources that people get upset over. Well, like what if we made like a motherhood Dow? Yeah, yeah. And, you know, used it to fund like single mothers, like, you know, pay for making babies. So, I mean, if you create and put beautiful things onto the world, that could be companies, that can be bridges, that could be art, that could be a lot of things, and that could be children, which are. Or education or. Anything, that should be valued by society, and that should be somehow incorporated into the framework of what, as a market, of what. Like, if you contribute children to this world, that should be valued and respected and sort of celebrated, like, proportional to what it is, which is, it's the thing that fuels human civilization. Yeah, like I. It's kind of important. I feel like everyone's always saying, I mean, I think we're in very different social spheres, but everyone's always saying, like, dismantle capitalism. And I'm like, well, okay, well, I don't think the government should own everything. Like, I don't think we should not have private ownership. Like, that's scary. You know, like that starts getting into weird stuff and just sort of like, I feel there's almost no way to do that without a police state, you know? But obviously, capitalism has some major flaws. And I think actually Mac showed me this idea called social capitalism, which is a form of capitalism that just like considers social good to be also profit. Like, you know, it's like, right now companies need to, like, you're supposed to grow every quarter or whatever to like show that you're functioning well, but it's like, okay, well, what if you kept the same amount of profit? You're still in the green, but then you have also all this social good. Like, do you really need all this extra economic growth or could you add this social good and that counts? And, you know, I don't know if, I am not an economist. I have no idea how this could be achieved, but. I don't think economists know how anything could be achieved either, but they pretend. It's the thing, they construct a model and they go on TV shows and sound like an expert. That's the definition of economist. How did being a mother, becoming a mother change you as a human being, would you say? Man, I think it kind of changed everything and it's still changing me a lot. It's actually changing me more right now in this moment than it was before. Like today, like this? Just like in the most recent months and stuff. Can you elucidate that, how change, like when you wake up in the morning and you look at yourself, it's again, which, who are you? How have you become different, would you say? I think it's just really reorienting my priorities. And at first I was really fighting against that because I somehow felt it was like a failure of feminism or something. Like I felt like it was like bad if like my kids started mattering more than my work. And then like more recently I started sort of analyzing that thought in myself and being like, that's also kind of a construct. It's like, we've just devalued motherhood so much in our culture that like, I feel guilty for caring about my kids more than I care about my work. So feminism includes breaking out of whatever the construct is. So just continually breaking, it's like freedom empower you to be free. And that means... But it also, but like being a mother, like I'm so much more creative. Like I cannot believe the massive amount of brain growth that I am. Why do you think that is? Just cause like the stakes are higher somehow? I think it's like, it's just so trippy watching consciousness emerge. It's just like, it's like going on a crazy journey or something. It's like the craziest science fiction novel you could ever read. It's just so crazy watching consciousness come into being. And then at the same time, like you're forced to value your time so much. Like when I have creative time now, it's so sacred. I need to like be really fricking on it. But the other thing is that I used to just be like a cynic and I used to just wanna... Like my last album was called Miss Anthropocene and it was like this like, it was like a study in villainy or like it was like, well, what if we have, instead of the old gods, we have like new gods and it's like Miss Anthropocene is like misanthrope like and Anthropocene, which is like the, you know, like and she's the goddess of climate change or whatever. And she's like destroying the world. And it was just like, it was like dark and it was like a study in villainy. And it was sort of just like, like I used to like have no problem just making cynical, angry, scary art. And not that there's anything wrong with that, but I think having kids just makes you such an optimist. It just inherently makes you wanna be an optimist so bad that like I feel more responsibility to make more optimistic things. And I get a lot of shit for it because everyone's like, oh, you're so privileged. Stop talking about like pie in the sky, stupid concepts and focus on like the now. But it's like, I think if we don't ideate about futures that could be good, we won't be able to get them. If everything is Blade Runner, then we're gonna end up with Blade Runner. It's like, as we said earlier, life imitates art. Like life really does imitate art. And so we really need more protopian or utopian art. I think this is incredibly essential for the future of humanity. And I think the current discourse where that's seen as a thinking about protopia or utopia is seen as a dismissal of the problems that we currently have. I think that is an incorrect mindset. And like having kids just makes me wanna imagine amazing futures that like maybe I won't be able to build, but they will be able to build if they want to. Yeah, it does seem like ideation is a precursor to creation. So you have to imagine it in order to be able to build it. And there is a sad thing about human nature that somehow a cynical view of the world is seen as a insightful view. You know, cynicism is often confused for insight, which is sad to see. And optimism is confused for naivete. Yes, yes. Like you don't, you're blinded by your, maybe your privilege or whatever. You're blinded by something, but you're certainly blinded. That's sad, that's sad to see because it seems like the optimists are the ones that create our future. They're the ones that build. In order to build the crazy thing, you have to be optimistic. You have to be either stupid or excited or passionate or mad enough to actually believe that it can be built. And those are the people that built it. My favorite quote of all time is from Star Wars, Episode 8, which I know everyone hates. Do you like Star Wars, Episode 8? No, yeah, probably I would say I would probably hate it, yeah. I don't have strong feelings about it. Let me backtrack. I don't have strong feelings about Star Wars. I'm a Tolkien person. I'm more into dragons and orcs and ogres. Yeah, I mean, Tolkien forever. I really want to have one more son and call him, I thought Tao Tecno Tolkien would be cool. It's a lot of T's, I like it. Yeah, and well, and Tao is six, two, eight, two pi. Yeah, Tao Tecno, yeah, yeah, yeah. And then techno is obviously the best genre of music, but also like technocracy. It just sounds really good. Yeah, that's right, and techno Tolkien, Tao Tecno Tolkien. That's a good, that's it. Tao Tecno Tolkien, but Star Wars, Episode 8, I know a lot of people have issues with it. Personally, on the record, I think it's the best Star Wars film. You're starting trouble today. Yeah, but don't kill what you hate, save what you love. Don't kill what you hate. Don't kill what you hate, save what you love. And I think we're, in society right now, we're in a diagnosis mode. We're just diagnosing and diagnosing and diagnosing, and we're trying to kill what we hate, and we're not trying to save what we love enough. And there's this Buckminster Fuller quote, which I'm gonna butcher, because I don't remember it correctly, but it's something along the lines of, don't try to destroy the old bad models, render them obsolete with better models. Maybe we don't need to destroy the oil industry. Maybe we just create a great new battery technology and sustainable transport, and just make it economically unreasonable to still continue to rely on fossil fuels. It's like, don't kill what you hate, save what you love. Make new things and just render the old things unusable. It's like if the college debt is so bad, and universities are so expensive, and I feel like education is becoming obsolete. I feel like we could completely revolutionize education, and we could make it free. And it's like, you look at JSTOR, and you have to pay to get all the studies and everything. What if we created a DAO that bought JSTOR, or we created a DAO that was funding studies, and those studies were open source, or free for everyone. And what if we just open sourced education and decentralized education and made it free, and all research was on the internet, and all the outcomes of studies were on the internet, and no one has student debt, and you just take tests when you apply for a job, and if you're qualified, then you can work there. This is just like, I don't know how anything works. I'm just randomly ranting, but. I like the humility. You gotta think from just basic first principles. What is the problem? What's broken? What are some ideas? That's it. And get excited about those ideas, and share your excitement, and don't tear each other down. It's just when you kill things, you often end up killing yourself. Like war is not a one sided, like you're not gonna go in and just kill them, like you're gonna get stabbed. It's like, and I think when I talk about this nexus point of that we're in this point in society where we're switching to intelligent design, I think part of our switch to intelligent design is that we need to choose nonviolence. And we need to, like, I think we can choose to start, I don't think we can eradicate violence from our species, because I think we need it a little bit, but I think we can choose to really reorient our primitive brains that are fighting over scarcity, and that are so attack oriented, and move into, we can optimize for creativity and building. Yeah, it's interesting to think how that happens, so some of it is just education, some of it is living life and introspecting your own mind, and trying to live up to the better angels of your nature for each one of us, all those kinds of things at scale. That's how we can sort of start to minimize the amount of destructive war in our world, and that's, to me, probably you're the same, technology is a really promising way to do that. Like, social media should be a really promising way to do that, it's a way we connect. I, you know, for the most part, I really enjoy social media. I just know all the negative stuff. I don't engage with any of the negative stuff. Just not even, like, by blocking or any of that kind of stuff, but just not letting it enter my mind. Like, just, like, when somebody says something negative, I see it, I immediately think positive thoughts about them, and I just forget they exist after that. Just move on, because, like, that negative energy, if I return the negative energy, they're going to get excited in a negative way right back, and it's just this kind of vicious cycle. But you would think technology would assist us in this process of letting go, of not taking things personally, of not engaging in the negativity, but unfortunately, social media profits from the negativity, so the current models. I mean, social media is like a gun. Like, you should take a course before you use it. Like, it's like, this is what I mean, like, when I say reprogram the human computer. Like, in school, you should learn about how social media optimizes to, you know, raise your cortisol levels and make you angry and crazy and stressed, and, like, you should learn how to have hygiene about how you use social media. But, so you can, yeah, choose not to focus on the negative stuff, but I don't know. I'm not sure social media should, I guess it should exist. I'm not sure. I mean, we're in the messy, it's the experimental phase. Like, we're working it out. Yeah, it's the early days. I don't even know, when you say social media, I don't know what that even means. We're in the very early days. I think social media is just basic human connection in the digital realm, and that, I think it should exist, but there's so many ways to do it in a bad way. There's so many ways to do it in a good way. There's all discussions of all the same human rights. We talk about freedom of speech. We talk about sort of violence in the space of digital media. We talk about hate speech. We talk about all these things that we had to figure out back in the day in the physical space. We're now figuring out in the digital space, and it's like baby stages. When the printing press came out, it was like pure chaos for a minute, you know? It's like when you inject, when there's a massive information injection into the general population, there's just gonna be, I feel like the printing press, I don't have the years, but it was like printing press came out, shit got really fucking bad for a minute, but then we got the enlightenment. And so it's like, I think we're in, this is like the second coming of the printing press. We're probably gonna have some shitty times for a minute, and then we're gonna have recalibrate to have a better understanding of how we consume media and how we deliver media. Speaking of programming the human computer, you mentioned Baby X. So there's this young consciousness coming to be, came from a cell. Like that whole thing doesn't even make sense. It came from DNA. Yeah. And then there's this baby computer that just like grows and grows and grows and grows, and now there's a conscious being with extremely impressive cognitive capabilities with, Have you met him? Yes, yeah. Yeah. He's actually really smart. He's really smart. Yeah. He's weird. Yeah. Or a baby. He does. I don't, I haven't. I don't know a lot of other babies, but he seems to be smart. Zach, I don't hang out with babies often, but this baby was very impressive. He does a lot of pranks and stuff. Oh, so he's like. Like he'll like give you a treat and then take it away and laugh and like stuff like that. So he's like a chess player. So here's a cognitive sort of, there's a computer being programmed. So he's taking in the environment, interacting with a specific set of humans. How would you, first of all, what is it? What, let me ask. I want to ask how do you program this computer? And also how do you make sense of that there's a conscious being right there that wasn't there before? It's giving me a lot of crisis thoughts. I'm thinking really hard. I think that's part of the reason it's like, I'm struggling to focus on art and stuff right now. Cause baby X is becoming conscious and like my it's just reorienting my brain. Like my brain is suddenly totally shifting of like, oh shit, like the way we raise children. Like, I hate all the baby books and everything. I hate them. Like they're, oh, the art is so bad. And like all this stuff, everything about all the aesthetics. And like, I'm just like, ah, like this is so. The programming languages we're using to program these baby computers isn't good. Yeah, like I'm thinking, and I, not that I have like good answers or know what to do, but I'm just thinking really, really hard about it. I, we recently watched Totoro with him, Studio Ghibli. And it's just like a fantastic film. And he like responded to, I know you're not supposed to show baby screens too much, but like, I think it's the most sort of like, I feel like it's the highest art baby content. Like it really speaks, there's almost no talking in it. It's really simple. Although all the dialogue is super, super, super simple, you know, and it's like a one to three year old can like really connect with it. Like it feels like it's almost aimed at like a one to three year old, but it's like great art and it's so imaginative and it's so beautiful. And like the first time I showed it to him, he was just like so invested in it, unlike I've ever, unlike anything else I'd ever shown him. Like he was just like crying when they cry and laughing when they laugh, like just like having this roller coaster of like emotions, like, and he learned a bunch of words. Like he was, and he started saying Totoro and started just saying all this stuff after watching Totoro, and he wants to watch it all the time. And I was like, man, why isn't there an industry of this? Like why aren't our best artists focusing on making art like for the birth of consciousness? Like, and that's one of the things I've been thinking I really wanna start doing. You know, I don't wanna speak before I do things too much, but like, I'm just like ages one to three, like we should be putting so much effort into that. And the other thing about Totoro is it's like, it's like better for the environment because adults love Totoro. It's such good art that everyone loves it. Like I still have all my old Totoro merch from when I was a kid. Like I literally have the most ragged old Totoro merch. Like everybody loves it, everybody keeps it. It's like, why does the art we have for babies need to suck and be not accessible to adults and then just be thrown out when, you know, they age out of it? Like, it's like, I don't know. I don't have like a fully formed thought here, but this is just something I've been thinking about a lot is like, how do we like, how do we have more Totoroesque content? Like how do we have more content like this that like is universal and everybody loves, but is like really geared to an emerging consciousness? Emerging consciousness in the first like three years of life that so much turmoil, so much evolution of mind is happening. It seems like a crucial time. Would you say to make it not suck, do you think of basically treating a child like they have the capacity to have the brilliance of an adult or even beyond that? Is that how you think of that mind or? No, cause they still, they like it when you talk weird and stuff. Like they respond better to, cause even they can imitate better when your voice is higher. Like people say like, oh, don't do baby talk. But it's like, when your voice is higher, it's closer to something they can imitate. So they like, like the baby talk actually kind of works. Like it helps them learn to communicate. I've found it to be more effective with learning words and stuff. But like, you're not speaking down to them. Like do they have the capacity\",\n          \"The following is a conversation with Sean Carroll. He's a theoretical physicist at Caltech specializing in quantum mechanics, gravity, and cosmology. He's the author of several popular books, one on the arrow of time called From Eternity to Here, one on the Higgs boson called Particle at the End of the Universe, and one on science and philosophy called The Big Picture on the Origins of Life, Meaning, and the Universe Itself. He has an upcoming book on quantum mechanics that you can preorder now called Something Deeply Hidden. He writes one of my favorite blogs on his website, preposterousuniverse.com. I recommend clicking on the Greatest Hits link that lists accessible, interesting posts on the arrow of time, dark matter, dark energy, the Big Bang, general relativity, string theory, quantum mechanics, and the big meta questions about the philosophy of science, God, ethics, politics, academia, and much, much more. Finally, and perhaps most famously, he's the host of a podcast called Mindscape that you should subscribe to and support on Patreon. Along with the Joe Rogan experience, Sam Harris's Making Sense, and Dan Carlin's Hardcore History, Sean's Mindscape podcast is one of my favorite ways to learn new ideas or explore different perspectives and ideas that I thought I understood. It was truly an honor to meet and spend a couple hours with Sean. It's a bit heartbreaking to say that for the first time ever, the audio recorder for this podcast died in the middle of our conversation. There's technical reasons for this, having to do with phantom power that I now understand and will avoid. It took me one hour to notice and fix the problem. So, much like the universe is 68% dark energy, roughly the same amount from this conversation was lost, except in the memories of the two people involved and in my notes. I'm sure we'll talk again and continue this conversation on this podcast or on Sean's. And of course, I look forward to it. This is the Artificial Intelligence podcast. If you enjoy it, subscribe on YouTube, iTunes, support it on Patreon, or simply connect with me on Twitter at Lex Friedman. And now, here's my conversation with Sean Carroll. What do you think is more interesting and impactful, understanding how the universe works at a fundamental level or understanding how the human mind works? You know, of course this is a crazy, meaningless, unanswerable question in some sense, because they're both very interesting and there's no absolute scale of interestingness that we can rate them on. There's a glib answer that says the human brain is part of the universe, right? And therefore, understanding the universe is more fundamental than understanding the human brain. But do you really believe that once we understand the fundamental way the universe works at the particle level, the forces, we would be able to understand how the mind works? No, certainly not. We cannot understand how ice cream works just from understanding how particles work, right? So I'm a big believer in emergence. I'm a big believer that there are different ways of talking about the world beyond just the most fundamental microscopic one. You know, when we talk about tables and chairs and planets and people, we're not talking the language of particle physics and cosmology. So, but understanding the universe, you didn't say just at the most fundamental level, right? So understanding the universe at all levels is part of that. I do think, you know, to be a little bit more fair to the question, there probably are general principles of complexity, biology, information processing, memory, knowledge, creativity that go beyond just the human brain, right? And maybe one could count understanding those as part of understanding the universe. The human brain, as far as we know, is the most complex thing in the universe. So there's, it's certainly absurd to think that by understanding the fundamental laws of particle physics, you get any direct insight on how the brain works. But then there's this step from the fundamentals of particle physics to information processing, which a lot of physicists and philosophers may be a little bit carelessly take when they talk about artificial intelligence. Do you think of the universe as a kind of a computational device? No, to be like, the honest answer there is no. There's a sense in which the universe processes information, clearly. There's a sense in which the universe is like a computer, clearly. But in some sense, I think, I tried to say this once on my blog and no one agreed with me, but the universe is more like a computation than a computer because the universe happens once. A computer is a general purpose machine, right? That you can ask it different questions, even a pocket calculator, right? And it's set up to answer certain kinds of questions. The universe isn't that. So information processing happens in the universe, but it's not what the universe is. And I know your MIT colleague, Seth Lloyd, feels very differently about this, right? Well, you're thinking of the universe as a closed system. I am. So what makes a computer more like a PC, like a computing machine is that there's a human that every once comes up to it and moves the mouse around. So input. Gives it input. Gives it input. And that's why you're saying it's just a computation, a deterministic thing that's just unrolling. But the immense complexity of it is nevertheless like processing. There's a state and then it changes with good rules. And there's a sense for a lot of people that if the brain operates, the human brain operates within that world, then it's simply just a small subset of that. And so there's no reason we can't build arbitrarily great intelligences. Yeah. Do you think of intelligence in this way? Intelligence is tricky. I don't have a definition of it offhand. So I remember this panel discussion that I saw on YouTube. I wasn't there, but Seth Lloyd was on the panel. And so was Martin Rees, the famous astrophysicist. And Seth gave his shtick for why the universe is a computer and explained this. And Martin Rees said, so what is not a computer? And Seth was like, oh, that's a good question. I'm not sure. Because if you have a sufficiently broad definition of what a computer is, then everything is, right? And the simile or the analogy gains force when it excludes some things. You know, is the moon going around the earth performing a computation? I can come up with definitions in which the answer is yes, but it's not a very useful computation. I think that it's absolutely helpful to think about the universe in certain situations, certain contexts, as an information processing device. I'm even guilty of writing a paper called Quantum Circuit Cosmology, where we modeled the whole universe as a quantum circuit. As a circuit. As a circuit, yeah. With qubits kind of thing? With qubits basically, right, yeah. So, and qubits becoming more and more entangled. So do we wanna digress a little bit? Let's do it. It's kind of fun. So here's a mystery about the universe that is so deep and profound that nobody talks about it. Space expands, right? And we talk about, in a certain region of space, a certain number of degrees of freedom, a certain number of ways that the quantum fields and the particles in that region can arrange themselves. That number of degrees of freedom in a region of space is arguably finite. We actually don't know how many there are, but there's a very good argument that says it's a finite number. So as the universe expands and space gets bigger, are there more degrees of freedom? If it's an infinite number, it doesn't really matter. Infinity times two is still infinity. But if it's a finite number, then there's more space, so there's more degrees of freedom. So where did they come from? That would mean the universe is not a closed system. There's more degrees of freedom popping into existence. So what we suggested was that there are more degrees of freedom, and it's not that they're not there to start, but they're not entangled to start. So the universe that you and I know of, the three dimensions around us that we see, we said those are the entangled degrees of freedom making up space time. And as the universe expands, there are a whole bunch of qubits in their zero state that become entangled with the rest of space time through the action of these quantum circuits. So what does it mean that there's now more degrees of freedom as they become more entangled? Yeah, so. As the universe expands. That's right, so there's more and more degrees of freedom that are entangled, that are playing part, playing the role of part of the entangled space time structure. So the basic, the underlying philosophy is that space time itself arises from the entanglement of some fundamental quantum degrees of freedom. Wow, okay, so at which point is most of the entanglement happening? Are we talking about close to the Big Bang? Are we talking about throughout the time of the life? Throughout history, yeah. So the idea is that at the Big Bang, almost all the degrees of freedom that the universe could have were there, but they were unentangled with anything else. And that's a reflection of the fact that the Big Bang had a low entropy. It was a very simple, very small place. And as space expands, more and more degrees of freedom become entangled with the rest of the world. Well, I have to ask John Carroll, what do you think of the thought experiment from Nick Bostrom that we're living in a simulation? So I think, let me contextualize that a little bit more. I think people don't actually take this thought experiments. I think it's quite interesting. It's not very useful, but it's quite interesting. From the perspective of AI, a lot of the learning that can be done usually happens in simulation from artificial examples. And so it's a constructive question to ask, how difficult is our real world to simulate? Right. Which is kind of a dual part of, if we're living in a simulation and somebody built that simulation, if you were to try to do it yourself, how hard would it be? So obviously we could be living in a simulation. If you just want the physical possibility, then I completely agree that it's physically possible. I don't think that we actually are. So take this one piece of data into consideration. You know, we live in a big universe, okay? There's two trillion galaxies in our observable universe with 200 billion stars in each galaxy, et cetera. It would seem to be a waste of resources to have a universe that big going on just to do a simulation. So in other words, I want to be a good Bayesian. I want to ask under this hypothesis, what do I expect to see? So the first thing I would say is I wouldn't expect to see a universe that was that big, okay? The second thing is I wouldn't expect the resolution of the universe to be as good as it is. So it's always possible that if our superhuman simulators only have finite resources, that they don't render the entire universe, right? That the part that is out there, the two trillion galaxies, isn't actually being simulated fully, okay? But then the obvious extrapolation of that is that only I am being simulated fully. Like the rest of you are just non player characters, right? I'm the only thing that is real. The rest of you are just chat bots. Beyond this wall, I see the wall, but there is literally nothing on the other side of the wall. That is sort of the Bayesian prediction. That's what it would be like to do an efficient simulation of me. So like none of that seems quite realistic. I don't see, I hear the argument that it's just possible and easy to simulate lots of things. I don't see any evidence from what we know about our universe that we look like a simulated universe. Now, maybe you can say, well, we don't know what it would look like, but that's just abandoning your Bayesian responsibilities. Like your job is to say under this theory, here's what you would expect to see. Yeah, so certainly if you think about simulation as a thing that's like a video game where only a small subset is being rendered. But say the entire, all the laws of physics, the entire closed system of the quote unquote universe, it had a creator. Yeah, it's always possible. Right, so that's not useful to think about when you're thinking about physics. The way Nick Bostrom phrases it, if it's possible to simulate a universe, eventually we'll do it. Right. You can use that by the way for a lot of things. Well, yeah. But I guess the question is, how hard is it to create a universe? I wrote a little blog post about this and maybe I'm missing something, but there's an argument that says not only that it might be possible to simulate a universe, but probably if you imagine that you actually attribute consciousness and agency to the little things that we're simulating, to our little artificial beings, there's probably a lot more of them than there are ordinary organic beings in the universe or there will be in the future, right? So there's an argument that not only is being a simulation possible, it's probable because in the space of all living consciousnesses, most of them are being simulated, right? Most of them are not at the top level. I think that argument must be wrong because it follows from that argument that, if we're simulated, but we can also simulate other things, well, but if we can simulate other things, they can simulate other things, right? If we give them enough power and resolution and ultimately we'll reach a bottom because the laws of physics in our universe have a bottom, we're made of atoms and so forth, so there will be the cheapest possible simulations. And if you believe the original argument, you should conclude that we should be in the cheapest possible simulation because that's where most people are. But we don't look like that. It doesn't look at all like we're at the edge of resolution, that we're 16 bit things. It seems much easier to make much lower level things than we are. And also, I questioned the whole approach to the anthropic principle that says we are typical observers in the universe. I think that that's not actually, I think that there's a lot of selection that we can do that we're typical within things we already know, but not typical within all of the universe. So do you think there's intelligent life, however you would like to define intelligent life, out there in the universe? My guess is that there is not intelligent life in the observable universe other than us, simply on the basis of the fact that the likely number of other intelligent species in the observable universe, there's two likely numbers, zero or billions. And if there had been billions, you would have noticed already. For there to be literally like a small number, like, you know, Star Trek, there's a dozen intelligent civilizations in our galaxy, but not a billion, that's weird. That's sort of bizarre to me. It's easy for me to imagine that there are zero others because there's just a big bottleneck to making multicellular life or technological life or whatever. It's very hard for me to imagine that there's a whole bunch out there that have somehow remained hidden from us. The question I'd like to ask is what would intelligent life look like? What I mean by that question and where it's going is what if intelligent life is just in some very big ways different than the one that has on Earth? That there's all kinds of intelligent life that operates at different scales of both size and temporal. Right, that's a great possibility because I think we should be humble about what intelligence is, what life is. We don't even agree on what life is, much less what intelligent life is, right? So that's an argument for humility, saying there could be intelligent life of a very different character, right? Like you could imagine the dolphins are intelligent but never invent space travel because they live in the ocean and they don't have thumbs, right? So they never invent technology, they never invent smelting. Maybe the universe is full of intelligent species that just don't make technology, right? That's compatible with the data, I think. And I think maybe what you're pointing at is even more out there versions of intelligence, intelligence in intermolecular clouds or on the surface of a neutron star or in between the galaxies in giant things where the equivalent of a heartbeat is 100 million years. On the one hand, yes, we should be very open minded about those things. On the other hand, all of us share the same laws of physics. There might be something about the laws of physics, even though we don't currently know exactly what that thing would be, that makes meters and years the right length and timescales for intelligent life. Maybe not, but we're made of atoms, atoms have a certain size, we orbit stars or stars have a certain lifetime. It's not impossible to me that there's a sweet spot for intelligent life that we find ourselves in. So I'm open minded either way, I'm open minded either being humble and there's all sorts of different kinds of life or no, there's a reason we just don't know it yet why life like ours is the kind of life that's out there. Yeah, I'm of two minds too, but I often wonder if our brains is just designed to quite obviously to operate and see the world in these timescales and we're almost blind and the tools we've created for detecting things are blind to the kind of observation needed to see intelligent life at other scales. Well, I'm totally open to that, but so here's another argument I would make, we have looked for intelligent life, but we've looked at for it in the dumbest way we can, by turning radio telescopes to the sky. And why in the world would a super advanced civilization randomly beam out radio signals wastefully in all directions into the universe? That just doesn't make any sense, especially because in order to think that you would actually contact another civilization, you would have to do it forever, you have to keep doing it for millions of years, that sounds like a waste of resources. If you thought that there were other solar systems with planets around them, where maybe intelligent life didn't yet exist, but might someday, you wouldn't try to talk to it with radio waves, you would send a spacecraft out there and you would park it around there and it would be like, from our point of view, it'd be like 2001, where there was a monolith. Monolith. There could be an artifact, in fact, the other way works also, right? There could be artifacts in our solar system that have been put there by other technologically advanced civilizations and that's how we will eventually contact them. We just haven't explored the solar system well enough yet to find them. The reason why we don't think about that is because we're young and impatient, right? Like, it would take more than my lifetime to actually send something to another star system and wait for it and then come back. So, but if we start thinking on hundreds of thousands of years or million year time scales, that's clearly the right thing to do. Are you excited by the thing that Elon Musk is doing with SpaceX in general? Space, but the idea of space exploration, even though your, or your species is young and impatient? Yeah. No, I do think that space travel is crucially important, long term. Even to other star systems. And I think that many people overestimate the difficulty because they say, look, if you travel 1% the speed of light to another star system, we'll be dead before we get there, right? And I think that it's much easier. And therefore, when they write their science fiction stories, they imagine we'd go faster than the speed of light because otherwise they're too impatient, right? We're not gonna go faster than the speed of light, but we could easily imagine that the human lifespan gets extended to thousands of years. And once you do that, then the stars are much closer effectively, right? And then what's a hundred year trip, right? So I think that that's gonna be the future, the far future, not my lifetime once again, but baby steps. Unless your lifetime gets extended. Well, it's in a race against time, right? A friend of mine who actually thinks about these things said, you know, you and I are gonna die, but I don't know about our grandchildren. That's, I don't know, predicting the future is hard, but that's at least a plausible scenario. And so, yeah, no, I think that as we discussed earlier, there are threats to the earth, known and unknown, right? Having spread humanity and biology elsewhere is a really important longterm goal. What kind of questions can science not currently answer, but might soon? When you think about the problems and the mysteries before us that may be within reach of science. I think an obvious one is the origin of life. We don't know how that happened. There's a difficulty in knowing how it happened historically actually, you know, literally on earth, but starting life from non life is something I kind of think we're close to, right? We're really. You really think so? Like how difficult is it to start life? Well, I've talked to people, including on the podcast about this. You know, life requires three things. Life as we know it. So there's a difference with life, which who knows what it is, and life as we know it, which we can talk about with some intelligence. So life as we know it requires compartmentalization. You need like a little membrane around your cell. Metabolism, you need to take in food and eat it and let that make you do things. And then replication, okay? So you need to have some information about who you are that you pass down to future generations. In the lab, compartmentalization seems pretty easy. Not hard to make lipid bilayers that come into little cellular walls pretty easily. Metabolism and replication are hard, but replication we're close to. People have made RNA like molecules in the lab that I think the state of the art is, they're not able to make one molecule that reproduces itself, but they're able to make two molecules that reproduce each other. So that's okay. That's pretty close. Metabolism is harder, believe it or not, even though it's sort of the most obvious thing, but you want some sort of controlled metabolism and the actual cellular machinery in our bodies is quite complicated. It's hard to see it just popping into existence all by itself. It probably took a while, but we're making progress. And in fact, I don't think we're spending nearly enough money on it. If I were the NSF, I would flood this area with money because it would change our view of the world if we could actually make life in the lab and understand how it was made originally here on earth. And I'm sure it'd have some ripple effects that help cure disease and so on. I mean, just that understanding. So synthetic biology is a wonderful big frontier where we're making cells. Right now, the best way to do that is to borrow heavily from existing biology, right? Well, Craig Venter several years ago created an artificial cell, but all he did was, not all he did, it was a tremendous accomplishment, but all he did was take out the DNA from a cell and put in entirely new DNA and let it boot up and go. What about the leap to creating intelligent life on earth? Yeah. Again, we define intelligence, of course, but let's just even say Homo sapiens, the modern intelligence in our human brain. Do you have a sense of what's involved in that leap and how big of a leap that is? So AI would count in this, or do you really want life? Do you want really an organism in some sense? AI would count, I think. Okay. Yeah, of course, of course AI would count. Well, let's say artificial consciousness, right? So I do not think we are on the threshold of creating artificial consciousness. I think it's possible. I'm not, again, very educated about how close we are, but my impression is not that we're really close because we understand how little we understand of consciousness and what it is. So if we don't have any idea what it is, it's hard to imagine we're on the threshold of making it ourselves. But it's doable, it's possible. I don't see any obstacles in principle. So yeah, I would hold out some interest in that happening eventually. I think in general, consciousness, I think we would be just surprised how easy consciousness is once we create intelligence. I think consciousness is a thing that's just something we all fake. Well, good. No, actually, I like this idea that in fact, consciousness is way less mysterious than we think because we're all at every time, at every moment, less conscious than we think we are, right? We can fool things. And I think that plus the idea that you not only have artificial intelligent systems, but you put them in a body, right, give them a robot body, that will help the faking a lot. Yeah, I think creating consciousness in artificial consciousness is as simple as asking a Roomba to say, I'm conscious, and refusing to be talked out of it. Could be, it could be. And I mean, I'm almost being silly, but that's what we do. That's what we do with each other. This is the kind of, that consciousness is also a social construct. And a lot of our ideas of intelligence is a social construct. And so reaching that bar involves something that's beyond, that doesn't necessarily involve the fundamental understanding of how you go from electrons to neurons to cognition. No, actually, I think that is an extremely good point. And in fact, what it suggests is, so yeah, you referred to Kate Darling, who I had on the podcast, and who does these experiments with very simple robots, but they look like animals, and they can look like they're experiencing pain, and we human beings react very negatively to these little robots looking like they're experiencing pain. And what you wanna say is, yeah, but they're just robots. It's not really pain, right? It's just some electrons going around. But then you realize, you and I are just electrons going around, and that's what pain is also. And so what I would have an easy time imagining is that there is a spectrum between these simple little robots that Kate works with and a human being, where there are things that sort of by some strict definition, Turing test level thing are not conscious, but nevertheless walk and talk like they're conscious. And it could be that the future is, I mean, Siri is close, right? And so it might be the future has a lot more agents like that. And in fact, rather than someday going, aha, we have consciousness, we'll just creep up on it with more and more accurate reflections of what we expect. And in the future, maybe the present, for example, we haven't met before, and you're basically assuming that I'm human as it's a high probability at this time because the yeah, but in the future, there might be question marks around that, right? Yeah, no, absolutely. Certainly videos are almost to the point where you shouldn't trust them already. Photos you can't trust, right? Videos is easier to trust, but we're getting worse that, we're getting better at faking them, right? Yeah, so physical embodied people, what's so hard about faking that? So this is very depressing, this conversation we're having right now. So I mean, To me, it's exciting. To me, you're doing it. So it's exciting to you, but it's a sobering thought. We're very bad, right? At imagining what the next 50 years are gonna be like when we're in the middle of a phase transition as we are right now. Yeah, and I, in general, I'm not blind to all the threats. I am excited by the power of technology to solve, to protect us against the threats as they evolve. I'm not as much as Steven Pinker optimistic about the world, but in everything I've seen, all of the brilliant people in the world that I've met are good people. So the army of the good in terms of the development of technology is large. Okay, you're way more optimistic than I am. I think that goodness and badness are equally distributed among intelligent and unintelligent people. I don't see much of a correlation there. Interesting. Neither of us have proof. Yeah, exactly. Again, opinions are free, right? Nor definitions of good and evil. We come without definitions or without data opinions. So what kind of questions can science not currently answer and may never be able to answer in your view? Well, the obvious one is what is good and bad? What is right and wrong? I think that there are questions that, science tells us what happens, what the world is and what it does. It doesn't say what the world should do or what we should do, because we're part of the world. But we are part of the world and we have the ability to feel like something's right, something's wrong. And to make a very long story very short, I think that the idea of moral philosophy is systematizing our intuitions of what is right and what is wrong. And science might be able to predict ahead of time what we will do, but it won't ever be able to judge whether we should have done it or not. So, you're kind of unique in terms of scientists. Listen, it doesn't have to do with podcasts, but even just reaching out, I think you referred to as sort of doing interdisciplinary science. So you reach out and talk to people that are outside of your discipline, which I always hope that's what science was for. In fact, I was a little disillusioned when I realized that academia is very siloed. Yeah. And so the question is, how, at your own level, how do you prepare for these conversations? How do you think about these conversations? How do you open your mind enough to have these conversations? And it may be a little bit broader, how can you advise other scientists to have these kinds of conversations? Not at the podcast, the fact that you're doing a podcast is awesome, other people get to hear them, but it's also good to have it without mics in general. It's a good question, but a tough one to answer. I think about a guy I know who's a personal trainer, and he was asked on a podcast, how do we psych ourselves up to do a workout? How do we make that discipline to go and work out? And he's like, why are you asking me? I can't stop working out. I don't need to psych myself up. So, and likewise, he asked me, how do you get to have interdisciplinary conversations on all sorts of different things, all sorts of different people? I'm like, that's what makes me go, right? Like that's, I couldn't stop doing that. I did that long before any of them were recorded. In fact, a lot of the motivation for starting recording it was making sure I would read all these books that I had purchased, right? Like all these books I wanted to read, not enough time to read them. And now if I have the motivation, cause I'm gonna interview Pat Churchland, I'm gonna finally read her book. You know, and it's absolutely true that academia is extraordinarily siloed, right? We don't talk to people. We rarely do. And in fact, when we do, it's punished. You know, like the people who do it successfully generally first became very successful within their little siloed discipline. And only then did they start expanding out. If you're a young person, you know, I have graduate students. I try to be very, very candid with them about this, that it's, you know, most graduate students are to not become faculty members, right? It's a tough road. And so live the life you wanna live, but do it with your eyes open about what it does to your job chances. And the more broad you are and the less time you spend hyper specializing in your field, the lower your job chances are. That's just an academic reality. It's terrible, I don't like it, but it's a reality. And for some people, that's fine. Like there's plenty of people who are wonderful scientists who have zero interest in branching out and talking to things, to anyone outside their field. But it is disillusioning to me. Some of the, you know, romantic notion I had of the intellectual academic life is belied by the reality of it. The idea that we should reach out beyond our discipline and that is a positive good is just so rare in universities that it may as well not exist at all. But that said, even though you're saying you're doing it like the personal trainer, because you just can't help it, you're also an inspiration to others. Like I could speak for myself. You know, I also have a career I'm thinking about, right? And without your podcast, I may have not have been doing this at all, right? So it makes me realize that these kinds of conversations is kind of what science is about in many ways. The reason we write papers, this exchange of ideas, is it's much harder to do interdisciplinary papers, I would say. And conversations are easier. So conversations is the beginning. And in the field of AI, it's obvious that we should think outside of pure computer vision competitions on a particular data sets. We should think about the broader impact of how this can be, you know, reaching out to physics, to psychology, to neuroscience and having these conversations so that you're an inspiration. And so never know how the world changes. I mean, the fact that this stuff is out there and I've a huge number of people come up to me, grad students, really loving the podcast, inspired by it. And they will probably have that, they'll be ripple effects when they become faculty and so on and so on. We can end on a balance between pessimism and optimism. And Sean, thank you so much for talking to me, it was awesome. No, Lex, thank you very much for this conversation.

first much prefer yann metaphor miles davis real explorer jazz coherent story think one one lived one think later historian look back revisit think happening right ai intellectual aspiration still alive today aspiration think akin development chemical engineering chemistry electrical engineering electromagnetism go back yet chemical engineering chemistry fluid flow mechanics people pretty clearly viewed interesting goals try build factories make chemicals products viably safely make good ones scale people started try course factories worked viable exploded parallel developed whole field called chemical engineering electrical engineering field bones theoretical aspects practical aspects engineering quote unquote real thing real concepts needed thing electrical engineering maxwell equations sense everything know electromagnetism needed figure build circuits build modules put together bring electricity one point another safely forth whole field developed called electrical engineering think happening right proto field statistics theoretical side algorithmic side computer science enough start build things things systems bring value human beings use human data mix human decisions engineering side ad hoc emerging fact wan na call machine learning field think proto form engineering based statistical computational ideas previous generations think something deeper ai dreams aspirations compared chemical engineering electrical engineering well dreams aspirations maybe years think like greeks sitting saying would neat get moon someday think clue brain computation clueless even worse greeks anything interesting scientifically era linger moment stand completely unique little bit unique clarity elaborate intuition like stand understanding human brain lot people say know scientists say far understanding human brain like saying dark well know unique even think clarity talk real neuroscientists really study real synapses real neurons agree agree hundreds year task building slowly surely signal clear think metaphors think electrical maybe chemical whole soup ions proteins cell even around like single synapse look electron micrograph single synapse city one little thing dendritic tree extremely complicated electrochemical thing spikes voltages flying around proteins taking taking dna knows problem next centuries fantastic metaphors economic device like immune system like layered set know arithmetic computations metaphors fun real science per se neuroscience neuroscience right like greek speculating get moon fun right think like say fairly strongly think lot young people think verge lot people talk clearly let understood yes kind brain inspired kind close know breakthroughs horizon scrupulous people sometimes need money labs saying scrupulous people oversell need money lab studying computational neuroscience going oversell much step gray area metaphor engineering sure familiar brain computer interfaces company like elon musk neuralink working putting electrodes brain trying able read read send electrical signals said even basic mechanism communication brain something understand hope without understanding fundamental principles brain works able something interesting gray area metaphor area hope sense like anybody else hopes interesting things happen research would expect something like alzheimer get figured modern neuroscience lot human suffering based brain disease throw things like lithium brain kind works one clue quite true mostly know even biochemistry brain leads mood swings thought emerges really really completely dim might want hook electrodes try signal processing try find patterns fine means go scientific point like kind sitting satellite watching emissions city trying infer things microeconomy even though microeconomic concepts really kind thing yes find signals something interesting useful control cursor mouse brain yeah absolutely imagine business models based even medical applications understanding algorithms allow us really tie deeply brain computer agree elon musk think even generations even century hopes getting dream mentioned kolmogorov turing might pop think might breakthroughs get sit back five years say wow oh sure think demos impress think computer call restaurant pretend human breakthrough right people know people present imitating human intelligence even putting coughs thing make bit pr stunt fine world runs things want diminish hard work engineering goes behind things like ultimate value human race scientific understanding know people work things scientific understanding meantime got kind know trains got run got mouths feed got things nothing wrong would call though engineering want distinguish engineering field like electrical engineering chemical engineering originally emerged real principles really know little scientific understanding maybe even complete became predictable really gave value human life understood want muddle much waters know able versus really ca way going impress next need wowed think someone comes along years younger person absorbed technology wowed think deeply impressed young kolmogorov would wowed stunts see right coming big companies demos think breakthroughs kolmogorov would give question chance think scientific fundamental principles arena think possible fundamental breakthroughs engineering meaning know would say things elon musk working spacex others sort trying revolutionize fundamentals engineering manufacturing saying problem know demo actually taking scale yeah going kinds breakthroughs like terminology scientist work things day day things move along eventually say wow something happened like language much also like prize theoretical breakthroughs practical ones tend theoretician think lots arena right would point kolmogorovs might point edisons era maybe musk bit like know musk god bless also say things ai knows little leads people astray talks things know anything trying program computer understand natural language involved dialogue right ai going happen lifetime could fake mimic sort take old sentences humans use retread deep understanding language going happen hope perceive deeper yet deeper kind aspects intelligence going happen breakthroughs think google breakthrough think amazon breakthrough know think uber breakthrough know bring value human beings scale new brand new ways based data flows lot things slightly broken kind engineering field takes economic value context data know planetary scale worries externalities privacy know field think things well see emerging know looking back years constituted breakthrough era like electrical engineering breakthrough early part last century chemical engineering breakthrough scale markets talk get seen sort breakthrough early days really interesting stuff get taking quick step back give kind throw historian hat mean briefly said history ai kind mimics history chemical engineering keep saying machine learning keep wanting say ai let know know resist think ai really john mccarthy almost philosopher saying would cool could put thought computer could mimic human capability think put intelligence sense computer interesting philosophical question wanted make philosophy wanted actually write logical formula algorithms would perfectly valid reasonable thing happening era reason keep saying ai actually love hear think machine learning particular set methods tools maybe version mine open optimization sampling systems learn machine learning systems learn make decisions make decisions pattern recognition know finding patterns making decisions real worlds close feedback loops something like symbolic ai expert systems reasoning systems knowledge based representation kinds things search neighbor fit think machine learning even like word machine learning think field talking making large collections decisions uncertainty large collections entities right principles scale say principles single entity making decisions single agent single human really immediately goes network decisions good word good words kind part problem continue conversation use ai want kind raise flag know intelligence real intelligence know much abstraction reasoning level humans clue trying build clue eventually may emerge make know breakthroughs eventually start get glimmers happening right okay taking data trying make good decisions based trying scale trying economically viably trying build markets trying keep value scale aspects look intelligent computers dumb seem intelligent use buzzword intelligence use sense machine learning scope narrowly learning data pattern recognition talk topics maybe data science another word could throw mix really important decisions part consequential decisions real world going medical operation going drive street things scarcity things impact human beings environments based data adaptively use computers help kinds things go forward whatever want call let call ai let agree call ai let say goal intelligence goal really good working systems planetary scale never seen reclaim word ai dartmouth conference many decades ago dream humans want reclaim want new word think bad choice mean read one little things history basically mccarthy needed new name cybernetics already existed like one really liked norbert wiener norbert wiener kind island felt encompassed sense look language cybernetics everything talking control theory signal processing notions intelligence closed feedback loops data word lived partly maybe personalities mccarthy needed new word say different part show got invented word thinking forward movies would made great choice thinking forward creating sober academic real world discipline terrible choice led promises true understand understand artificial perhaps understand intelligence small tangent one great personalities machine learning whatever heck call field think science progresses personalities fundamental principles theories research outside personalities would say one kind personality mine preferences kind network around feeds agree disagree kinds personalities needed right think personality little exuberant little bit ready promise moon little bit much ascendance think good certainly attracts lots young people field lot people come strong misconceptions unlearn find something think got multiple voices hearing enough sober voice continuation fun tangent speaking vibrant personalities would yeah think technically speaking possible help know answers less anonymity little locality know worlds kind enter trust people worlds start discussion know people going hurt going total waste time lot wasting time know lot us pulled facebook early cause clearly going waste lot time even though value yeah worlds somehow enter know getting kind appeals might new things might happen kind trust world deep interesting complex psychological aspects around anonymity changes human behavior quite dark quite dark yeah think lot us especially us really loved advent technology love social networks came see negatives started seeing comment sections think maybe know cnn something started go wow darkness know technology amplifying sorry big philosophical question topic think human beings cause also things foot psychology think human beings fundamentally good like us good intent could mind depending context environment everybody could evil answer fundamentally good fundamentally limited us know blinkers see person pain easily see person point view easily much head world good days think technology could open us know perspectives less blinkered understanding know lot wars human history happened ignorance thought person person huge amounts lifetime seen technology really help way yet believe know think fundamentally humans good people suffer people grievances grudges things cause things probably would want regret often think know part progress technology indeed allow little easier real good person actually well think individual human life society could modeled optimization problem way think typically mean talking one complex phenomenon whole know individual human life society whole mean individual human life amazingly complex know optimization kind one branch mathematics talks certain kinds things feels way limited complexity things properties optimization problems think think interesting problems could solved optimization kind properties surface non convexity convexity linearity kinds things saddle points well optimization one piece mathematics know like even era aware say sampling coming examples something coming distribution optimization sampling well kind certain kind mathematician try blend make seem sort thing optimization roughly speaking trying find point single point optimum criterion function kind sampling trying surface treat distribution density find points high density want entire distribution sampling paradigm want know single point best point optimization paradigm optimizing space probability measures output could whole probability distribution start make things mathematics go high kind abstraction hierarchy start lose know ability interesting theorems kind try try overly abstract small tangent kind worldview find appealing one deterministic stochastic well easy mean statistician know world highly stochastic know going happen next five minutes right going ask going say due uncertainty due massive uncertainty yeah know massive uncertainty best come rough sense probability distribution things somehow use reasoning distributed scale multi agent systems look like optimization optimize sort makes lot sense sort least robotics perspective single robot single agent trying optimize objective function start enter real world game theoretic concept starts popping see optimization talked markets scale look like see optimization see sampling see like mark blend together system designer thinking build incentivized system blend things know particle potential well optimizing functional called lagrangian right particle know algorithm running happens description mathematically something helps us understand analysts happening right thing happen talk know mixtures humans computers markets forth certain principles allow us understand happening whether actual algorithms used sense clear point may set multi agent market kind system thinking individual agent system asked task incentivized way get certain signals utility point wo know answer may optimize find answer okay artist could embedded inside overall market know game theory broad often studied narrowly certain kinds problems roughly speaking know going kind anticipate little bit anticipate anticipating kind go back forth minds run kind thought experiments talked interesting point terms game theory know optimization problems really hate saddle points maybe describe saddle points heard kind mentioned branch optimization could try explicitly look saddle points good thing oh optimization game theory kinds different equilibria game theory highly explanatory behavior attempting algorithmic trying say happen equilibrium would see certain kind behavior see real life economist wants especially behavioral economists continuous differential game theory continuous spaces simplest equilibria saddle points nash equilibrium saddle point special kind saddle point classically game theory trying find nash equilibria algorithmic game theory trying find algorithms would find trying find saddle points mean literally trying know economist knows nash equilibria limitations definitely explanatory many situations really want kind equilibria names associated came history certain people working new ones emerging know one example stackelberg equilibrium know nash playing game maybe cooperative going think going decide going thing simultaneously know stackelberg going first mover going make move going look move going make since know going look move anticipate going something stupid know also anticipating kind going back forth first mover thing different equilibria right mathematically yeah things certain topologies certain shapes like algorithmically dynamically move towards move away things know questions answers studied others especially becomes stochastic especially large numbers decentralized things know young people get field kind think done know tensorflow well open problems really important interesting strategic settings collect data suppose know going know well right well got collect data maybe want push part space know much get data cause later realize never never go way game set know part overall know data analysis context even game poker fascinating space whenever uncertainty lack information super exciting space linger optimization second look deep learning essentially minimization complicated loss function something insightful hopeful see kinds function surface loss functions deep learning real world trying optimize something interesting usual kind problems optimization think optimization point view surface first pretty smooth secondly parameterized kind lots paths reasonable optima kind getting downhill optimum viewed hard might expected high dimensions fact optima tend really good ones others good tend sometimes find good ones sort still needs explanation yeah particular surface coming particular generation neural nets kind suspect change years exactly surfaces others optimization theory help contribute surfaces algorithms years arithmetic operations little bit nonlinearity come neuroscience per se mean maybe minds people working thinking brains arithmetic circuits kinds fields computer science control theory layers could transform things certain ways smooth maybe could find parameter values sort big discovery working able work scale think stuck certainly stuck cause understanding brain terms algorithm side sort gradient descent think stuck gradient descent variance variance find interesting think something else invented able walk optimization spaces interesting ways co design surface architecture algorithm ask stay kind architectures neural nets know phase retrieval architectures matrix completion architectures know think kind come place yeah stochastic gradient algorithms dominant versions little better others guarantees robust ongoing research kind figure best arm situation think start co evolve put pressure actual architecture particular way different way algorithm available different way ca really anticipate co evolution process know gradients amazing mathematical objects lot people start study deeply mathematically kind shocked think way suppose tell move along x axis go uphill objective three units whereas move along axis go uphill seven units right going allow move certain unit distance right going well people say going go along axis getting biggest bang buck know buck one unit going put axis right even take strength step size put x axis getting less bang buck seems like completely clear argument wrong gradient direction go along axis take little bit x axis understand know math even trivial called operator like gradient trivial know exploiting properties still important know pervading descent got kinds problems gets stuck many ways never know good dimension dependence line work recently kinds stochasticity get dimension dependence theory come pretty favorable results certain kinds stochasticity sufficient conditions generally know give good guarantee necessary conditions must done certain way general stochasticity much randomness inject walking along gradient kind randomness randomness good process stochasticity good yeah give simple answers sense kind amazing stochasticity know particular features surface could hurt one thing deterministically wo hurt chance little chance would get hurt stochasticity kind saves particular features surfaces fact think surfaces discontinuous first derivative like absolute value function go hit point nondifferentiability running deterministic algorithm point really something bad whereas stochasticity means pretty unlikely going happen going hit point nontrivial analyze especially higher dimensions also stochasticity intuition good properties kind appealing high dimensions lot large number reasons part mathematics kind fun work field get try understand mathematics long story short know partly empirically discovered stochastic gradient effective theory kind followed say see getting clearly beautiful mysterious profound idea optimization know let say nesterov work nesterov acceleration pretty surprising pretty deep elaborate well nesterov acceleration suppose going use gradients move around space reasons alluded nice directions move suppose tell allowed use gradients going allowed use local person sense kind change surface going give kind computer able store previous gradients start learn something surface going restrict maybe move direction like linear span gradients ca kind move arbitrary direction right well defined mathematical complexity model certain classes algorithms others ca ask certain kinds surfaces fast get optimum answers smooth convex function answer one number steps squared within ball size k steps gradient descent particular slower rate one could ask gradient descent actually even though know good algorithm best algorithm answer well clear yet one k squared lower bound probably best gradient one k something better think surprise nesterov discovered new algorithm got two pieces two gradients puts together certain kind obscure way thing even move downhill time sometimes goes back uphill physicist kind makes sense building momentum kind right intuition intuition enough understand kind works achieves one k squared mathematical structure still kind day lot us writing papers trying explore understand lots cool ideas optimization kind using gradients think number one goes back know years nesterov think made major contribution idea like said gradients sense mysterious trivial trivial coordinate descent trivial one pick one coordinates think human mind thinks human minds think gradients easy human mind grapple absurd question statistics little bit somewhere math science technology somewhere convex hole set principles allow make inferences got reason believed also principles allow make decisions reason believe going make errors requires assumptions mean error mean probabilities start making assumptions led conclusions yes guarantee way probability making error small probability continuing make errors time small probability found something real small high decision making big part decision making big part yeah statistics short history goes back formal discipline years called inverse probability around era probability developed sort especially explain gambling situations course interesting would say well given state nature certain roulette board certain mechanism kind outcomes expect see especially things long amounts time outcomes see physicists started pay attention people said well let turn problem around saw certain outcomes could infer underlying mechanism inverse problem fact quite statistics called inverse probability name field believe laplace working napoleon government needed census france learn people went gathered data analyzed data determine policy said well let call field kind thing statistics word state french etat study data state anyway caught called statistics ever since time got formalized sort around time game theory decision theory developed nearby people era think either computer science statistics control econ von neumann developing game theory also thinking decision theory wald econometrician developing decision theory turning statistics data analyze loss function care question trying ask probability model risk face make certain decisions day advanced statistical curricula teach decision theory starting point branches two branches bayesian frequentist decisions statistics beautiful mysterious maybe surprising idea come across yeah good question mean bunch surprising ones something way technical thing something called james stein estimation kind surprising really takes time wrap head around try maybe think want even want try let say colleague steven stigler university chicago wrote really beautiful paper james stein estimation helps views paradox kind defeats mind attempts understand steve nice perspective one troubles statistics like physics quantum physics multiple interpretations wave particle duality physics get used time still kind haunts really quite understand relationship electron wave electron particle well thing happens bayesian ways thinking frequentist different sometimes become sort practice physically different practice give rather different answers much like wave particle duality something kind get used field define bayesian frequentist yeah decision theory make video people could see called bayesian frequentist kind help try make really clear comes decision theory know decision theory talking loss functions function data x parameter theta function two arguments okay neither one arguments known know data priori random parameters unknown right function two things know trying say want function small want small loss right well going sort say well going average quantities maximize something know turn uncertainty something certain could look first argument average could look second argument average bayesian frequentist frequentist says going look x data going take random going average distribution take expectation loss theta held fixed right called risk looking data sets could get right say well certain procedure data sets called frequentist guarantee right think appropriate like building piece software shipping people using kinds data sets want stamp guarantee people run many many data sets never even thought time right thing perfectly reasonable bayesian perspective says well going look argument loss function theta part okay unknown uncertain could personal probability know many tall people trying infer average height population idea roughly height going average theta loss function one argument gone function x bayesian say well let focus particular x got data set got condition conditional x say something loss bayesian approach things bayesian argue relevant look data sets could gotten average frequentist approach really data sets got right agree especially situations working scientist learn lot domain really focused certain kinds data gathered data make inferences agree though know sense needs frequentist guarantees writing software people using want say something two things got fight little bit blend long story short set ideas right middle called empirical bayes empirical bayes sort starts bayesian framework kind arguably philosophically know reasonable kosher write bunch math kind flows realize bunch things know real world know everything uncertain certain quantities point ask reasonable way plug estimate things okay cases quite reasonable thing plug natural thing observe world plug little bit mathematics assure really good based math based human expertise good oh going bayesian framework allows put lot human expertise math kind guides along path kind reassures end could put stamp approval certain assumptions thing work asked question favorite know surprising nice idea one accessible something called false discovery rate know making one hypothesis test making one decision making whole bag bag decisions look ones made discovery announced something interesting happened right going subset big bag ones made discovery subset bad false false discoveries like fraction false discoveries among discoveries small different criterion accuracy precision recall sensitivity specificity different quantity latter ones almost frequentist flavor say given truth null hypothesis true accuracy would get given alternative true would get kind going forward state nature data bayesian goes direction data back state nature actually false discovery rate says given made discovery okay conditioned data probability hypothesis going direction classical frequency look well ca know priors needed empirical bayesian goes ahead plows forward starts writing formulas realizes point things actually estimated reasonable way kind beautiful set ideas kind line argument come certainly mine sort came robbins around brad efron written beautifully various papers books fdr know benjamin israel john story bayesian interpretation used absorb things years find healthy way think statistics let ask intelligence jump slightly back philosophy perhaps said maybe elaborate said defining even question intelligence difficult question useful question think one day understand fundamentals human intelligence means know good benchmarks general intelligence put machines work topics much really asking question psychologist really studied consider least expert point know psychologist aims understand human intelligence right think many psychologists know fairly humble might try understand baby understands know whether something solid liquid whether something hidden maybe child starts learn meaning certain words verb noun also know slowly surely trying figure things humans ability take really complicated environment reason abstract find right abstractions communicate interact know really staggeringly rich complicated know think humility think kind aiming near future certain psychologist experiments babies lab people talking much limited aspiration know kahneman tversky would look reasoning patterns deeply understanding reasoning sort saying hey oddities reasoning things think also emphasize things writing know ai revolution happened yet yeah great blog post emphasizing know step back look intelligent systems kind whatever mean intelligence humans animals know plants whatever know market brings goods city know food restaurants something every day system decentralized set decisions looking far enough away like collection neurons every neuron making little decisions presumably way step back enough every little part economic system making decisions like brain knows individual neuron overall goal right something happens aggregate level thing economy

another kind intelligence probably third kinds intelligence fourth none us really thinking much right really relevant computer systems future certainly market one relevant right whereas understanding human intelligence clear relevant right probably want general intelligence whatever one means know understanding intelligence deep sense definitely human intelligence got ta broader thing mystery

titled artificial intelligence revolution happened yet calling broadening scope ai field embrace fact witnessing creation new branch engineering term engineering often invoked narrow sense academia beyond overtones cold effectless machinery negative connotations loss control humans engineering discipline want current era real opportunity conceive something historically new human centric engineering discipline resist giving emerging discipline name acronym ai continues used let aware real limitations placeholder let broaden scope tone hype recognize serious challenges ahead thank listening hope see next time say interesting disagreement jan lacune jan old friend say think disagree much really kind let build kind mentality work kind mentality kind concrete speak french speak french together lot common one wanted highlight disagreement really fundamental one think kind emphasizing jan emphasized pattern recognition emphasized prediction interesting try take far could perfect prediction would give kind thought experiment think way limited perfect prediction never data sets allow figure ready question going ask next clue never know things moreover us find day kinds situations anticipation kind novel various ways moment want think want also going market forces acting us like go street full crane street got got think got think might really want got sort think much costs action versus action got think risks involved lot current pattern recognition prediction systems risk evaluations error bars right got think people decisions around got think collection decisions even thinking like medical treatment know going take prediction neural net health something consequential ready heart attack number even data world ever collected heart attacks better doctor ever going trust output neural net predict heart attack going want ask questions around going want look us possible data causal things going want dialogue doctor things think gathered data know could go hope see think say predictions everything missing stuff prediction plus decision making everything equally important field emphasized prediction jan rightly seen powerful cost people aware decision making rubber really hits road human lives stake risks taken got gather data got think error bars got think consequences decisions others got think economy around decisions blah blah blah blah one working smaller tribe right one people talk know go real world industry know amazon say half people working decision making half know pattern recognition important words pattern recognition prediction think distinction linger words distinction constrained sort lab data set versus decision making talking consequential decisions real world messiness uncertainty real world whole whole mess actually touches human beings scale forces distinction helps add perspective broader perspective right totally agree hand real prediction person course want real world want predict real world events saying possible data sets context know strategic things someone data might gather things could gathered reasoning process around data taking data making predictions based data one things working sure others working hear often talked especially clarity talk think exciting concerning area ai terms decision making talked ai systems help make decisions scale distributed way millions billions decisions sort markets decisions starting point sort give example system think thinking kinds systems yeah first absolutely getting territory beyond expertise lots things going obvious think like like think history little bit think put back sixties kind banking system computerized really database theory emerging database people think actually move data around actual money know valid transactions atms happen actually know valid forth kind issues get start get serious sorts things like like think kind almost thought experiment help think something simpler music market first order music market world right country sure something called things called record companies make money prop really good musicians make superstars make huge amounts money long tail huge numbers people make lots lots really good music actually listened people famous people market career make money creators creators creators called influencers whatever diminishes people make extremely good music especially hip hop latin world days laptop weekend another job week put soundcloud sites eventually gets streamed gets turned bits economically valuable information lost gets put people stream walk around big city see people headphones especially young kids listening music time look data little music listening famous people music none old music latest stuff people made latest stuff like year old somewhere never make career never make money course counter examples record companies incentivize pick highlight long story short missing market consumer producer relationship level actual creative acts pipelines spotify world take stuff stream along make money subscriptions advertising things making money right offer bits pieces people highlight simulate market anyway real market would creator music actually somebody good enough people want listen data available dashboard showing map united states last week places songs listened transparent vetable someone providence sees listened times providence know real data know real data come give show broadcast people listening coming right could go make three times year start career sense ai creates jobs taking away human jobs creating new jobs creates new market created market connected producers consumers person making music say someone comes shows lot hey play daughter wedding say say get income going millionaire even think really value music personal connections even much young kid wants wear tshirt favorite musician signature listen music internet internet able provide button push merchandise arrives next day well kid bought shirt happy person made music get money advertising needed create markets producers consumers take cut company perfectly sound go forward future create new markets raises human happiness seems like well easy create dashboard kind create connections think uber whatever think challenges real world things like actually new principles going needed trying create new kind two way market different scale ever done going unwanted aspects market bad people data get used wrong ways fail ways wo deliver think like anyone ran big auction ran big matching service economics think things maybe get huge issues arise start create markets starts least solidify thoughts allow move forward thinking yeah talked head research spotify actually think longterm goal said least one million creators make comfortable living putting spotify think articulate really nice vision world digital cyberspace markets think companies like spotify youtube netflix create markets ai problem interface problem interface design kind economics problem hire solve problems well part top silicon valley attitude know create system like google search box good everyone adopt everything said really think missing kind culture literally year old able create songs create silicon valley entity hire per se create ecosystem wanted belong cultural credibility things like netflix credit wanted credibility created shows content call content terrible word culture movies kind go give large sum money somebody graduating usc film school whole thing kind like rich white people thing american culture much rich white people immigrants africans came brought culture rhythms world created whole new thing american culture companies ca artificially create ca say hey going buy got partner anyway denigrate companies trying sure asking questions even making effort partly respect culture technology person got blend technology cultural meaning much role think algorithm machine learning connecting consumer creator sort recommender system aspect yeah great question think pretty high magic algorithms good recommender system way better bad recommender system recommender systems billion dollar industry back even years ago continues extremely important going forward favorite recommender system put something well historically one first went amazon first like amazon put book people business library local booksellers went business come accept probably books sold poor people reading ever local book stores coming back economics sometimes work go go anyway finally started going bought books really pleased see another books recommended never would thought bought bunch obviously good business model learned things still day kind browse using service think lots people get lot good aspect recommendation system learning peers indirect way algorithms meant impose learn really trying find data work well kinds entities complexity human life like shirts going get recommendations shirts interesting try recommend restaurants hard hard scale blend recommendation systems economic ideas matchings really really still open research wise new companies going emerge well think going messy difficult land say politics things like youtube twitter deal terms recommendation systems able suggest think facebook launched facebook news recommend kind news likely interesting think ai solvable whatever term want use think solvable problem machines deeply human problem unsolvable even think level think broken companies monetization advertising least facebook want critique really try connect producer consumer economic way right one wants pay anything know starting google facebook went back playbook know television companies back day one wanted pay signal pay tv box signal least back day advertising kind filled gap advertising new interesting somehow take lives quite right fast forward google provides service people want pay somewhat surprisingly nineties made ended making huge amounts cornered advertising market seem like going happen least little things right hand side screen seem economically interesting companies maybe choice tv market going away billboards got think sadly google well making money think much wait minute producer consumer relationship set us advertisers market created actual market producer consumer producers person created video clip person made website person could make things person could adjust function demand person side asking different kinds things know see glimmers influencers kind little glimmering market done years ago thought created parallel advertising ecosystem facebook inherited think also think much fast forward making huge amounts money advertising news thing clicks feeding advertising connected advertiser want people click certain things money flows facebook much incentivized start find breaking people telling well getting troubles try adjust smart ai algorithms right figure bad clicks maybe click rate something else find pretty much hopeless get complexity human life try fix could also fix whole business model business model really human producers consumers economic value liberated connecting directly valuable people able pay right micro payments like small payments micro even micro like example suppose going next week going india never india right couple days mumbai idea right could go web right search going kind hopeless going find know lots advertisers face right really want broadcast world going mumbai someone side market look recommendation system looking possible people coming mumbai looking people relevant someone age group someone kind knows level give little privacy happy going get back person make little video going write little two page paper cool things want move week especially right going look going pay micro payment going pay know hundred dollars whatever real value like journalism um honest subscription going pay person moment company going take person got gig economy know done know thinking little bit behind youtube actually people could make things connected market would make things independently tell incentivize way um yeah companies think thought long hard distinguish facebook one side thought things think uh thinking ai fix everything uh amazon thinks time already real world delivering packages people doors worried market worried sellers know worry things great things maybe great know business model say google sort hovers somewhere think long long time got think probably see youtube pregnant possibility might thought probably heading direction um uh know silicon valley dominated google facebook kind mentality subscription advertising core problem right fake news actually rides top means monetizing clip rate core problem got remove advertisement going linger mean interesting thesis know everyone really deeply thinks right thought advertising model thing thing ever fix build algorithms despite business model know find better angels nature good society individual think slowly think first difference could saying slowly move away advertising model direct connection consumer creator question also advertising model successful terms making huge amount money therefore able build big company provides really smart people working create good service think possible clarify think move away well think yeah know society yeah well companies mean first full disclosure day week amazon kind want learn things know speaking amazon way know go actually believe get little bit trying create markets really use advertising crucial part well good question become crucial become present go amazon website know without revealing many deep secrets amazon tell know lot people company question huge questioning going want world zero advertising actually bad world okay way think company like amazon trying bring products customers right customer given moment want buy vacuum cleaner say want know available know going obvious little bit work recommendation system sort help right suppose person made world know spent huge amount energy great idea made great vacuum cleaner know really nailed mit know whiz kid made great new vacuum cleaner right going recommendation system one know algorithms find ai fix okay right allow vacuum cleaner start get front people sold well advertising advertising signal believe product enough willing pay real money consumer look signal say well first know cheap little ads cause right know know super cheap know pennies see ad actually know company making know real money kind flowing see ad may pay attention actually might want see hey guy spent money vacuum cleaner maybe something good look part overall information flow good market advertising role problem course signal completely gone know dominant tiny little things add big money company know think think change societies know stick things annoy lot people advertising currently annoys people provides information think google probably smart enough figure dead bad model even though hard huge amount money figure pull away slowly sure ceo figure need needed reduce advertising zero reduce time bring producer consumer actual real value delivered real money paid take cut could start get big enough cancel lost revenue kind poor kind advertising think good company realize facebook know god bless bring know grandmothers bring children pictures grandmothers lives fantastic need think new business model core problem start connect producer consumer think continue make money buy next social network company buy next one innovation level high health issues go away apologize kind returned words think exact terms matter sort defense advertisement think kind direct connection consumer creator producer advertisement strives right best advertisement literally facebook listening conversation heard going india able actually start automatically making connections start giving offer like apologize matter terms draw distinction possible make advertisements better better better algorithmically actually becomes connection almost direct connection good question let component first talked defending advertising okay defending way get signals market come way especially algorithmically sign someone spent money sign think valuable think things someone else thinks valuable trust people might willing listen trust facebook though intermediary think care okay think find creepy know going india next week conversation think could put pr hat think find facebook creepy trust majority population silicon valley companies saw like approval rate ranking much people trust companies facebook gutter gutter including people inside facebook attribute come find creepy right talking might walk street right unknown person know kind comes says hear going india mean even facebook want transparency human society want know something actually reason know something something look later audit kind approve know something care way caring relationship even economic one something someone could exploit ways know care troubled whatever world right happens way much facebook knows things lot people could exploit exploit times think people find creepy facebook care real sense big brother caring us role company like wait big brother part caring trusting mean companies link lot companies lot information us would argue companies like microsoft information us facebook yet trust microsoft well microsoft pivoting microsoft know satya nadella decided really important want creepy things really want people trust us actually use information ways really would approve decide right kind adding health market connect someone produces consumer random producer consumer people see like sense transact happiness go sides company helps moments choose choosing fine also think difference know browsing versus buying right moments life want buy know gadget something need something moment need ammonia house something got problem spill want go want advertised moment want led various know annoying want go extremely easy want moments might say like today going shopping mall want walk around see things see people exposed stuff want control though want company algorithms decide right think thing total loss control facebook thinks take control us deciding want certain kinds information information much relates know us really want know us want helping way want helping decide control want totally agree facebook way optimistic thing think facebook kind personal information us could create beautiful thing really optimistic facebook could could see think optimism misplaced bit business model behind things create beautiful thing really let let clear something people would value think business model think suddenly discover know long hot shower disagree disagree terms discover lot amazing things shower say said wo come wo shower think lot people discover think guy also full disclosure company called united masters board created music market hundred thousand artists signed done things like gone nba nba music find behind nba clips right music right company right business model mind get go right executed day one value brought kid made songs suddenly songs nba website right real economic value people know differ optimism able sort change direction titanic right yeah older seen titanic crash got elaborate cause totally agree want know difficult think problem example want read news would lot times day something makes either smile think way like consciously think really gave value like sometimes listen daily podcasts new york times way better new york times way people listening like real journalism happening reason podcast space make sense often listen minutes would willing pay like experience difficult kind getting little transaction difficult create frictionless system like uber example things intuition first pay little bits money know send something called courts financial things like medium site pay would great post medium would loved pay dollar others would wanted per se also sites actually goal goal actually broadcast channel monetize way chose mean could people know could fine also musicians making music think right model pay little subscription fee right people copy bits easily somewhere value value connection made real human beings follow right create yet value think lot open questions hot open questions also yeah want good recommendation systems recommend cool stuff pretty hard right like recommend stuff based browsing history like based stuff know quote unquote unknown interesting really interesting question may disagree maybe think love recommender systems want give everything way trust yeah example morning clicked know pretty sleepy morning clicked story queen england yes right give damn queen england really clickbait kind looked funny say heck talking want life know heading direction browsing history system reasonable system think care queen england browsing history right saying trace digital exhaust whatever kind models collect stuff going figure us well trying figure like kind one person like trump something maybe could figure trying figure know million people know way way think think think humans amazingly rich complicated every one us little quirks every one us little things could intrigue us even know intrigue us sign past god comes know fall love want company trying figure anticipate want provide forum market place kind go hook crook happens know walking street hear chilean music played never knew liked chilean music wow side want provide limited know interesting place go right try use ai kind know figure put world figured know create huge spaces human beings creativity style enriched come forward lot transparency wo people randomly anonymously putting comments special based stuff know facts know broken right know especially celebrity know anybody anonymous people hurting lots lots people right part thing silicon valley thinking know collect information use great way pessimist much optimist nature think wrong path whole technology take limited create let humans rise try replace ai mantra try anticipate try predict going going able things going make things worse okay right give chance right recommender systems creepy people shadow watching every move looking traces directly interacting sort close friends family way know conversation actually interactions back forth think place recommender systems sort step cause emphasize value human human connection yeah give chance ai human connection role ai system conversations terms try figure kind music like watching listening actually conversation natural language otherwise yeah wanted push back maybe saying options facebook think misplaced think distributing yeah good go hard spot yeah good human interaction like daily context around home something want big company know would happy technology help kind technology well know alexa amazon well good alexa done right think alexa research platform right anything else alexa done right know could things like leave water running garden say hey alexa water running garden even alexa figure means wife comes home told little bit reasoning would call ai kind stretch little bit reasoning actually kind would make life little easier better know would call wow moment kind think overall rises human happiness kind thing lonely alexa knowing loneliness want alexa feel intrusive want designer system kind work really want lot control want transparency control company stand give context new technology think good first way successful current generation like said mentioning microsoft really think pivoting kind trusted old uncle know think get way go let people find technology empowers control control privacy rich set interactions people going like lot right business model going forward control privacy look like think able view data much mean first individual decision people want privacy want whole life people want privacy zero one legal thing data available like recall people know couple hundred years ago everyone really big cities everyone lived countryside villages villages everybody knew everything privacy bad better well know arguably get loss certain kinds privacy well people help know everything know something bad happening help right live big city one knows get help kind depends answer want certain people trust relationships kind manage knows agency drift sea technology agency want go reading things checking boxes know privacy researcher per se recognize vast complexity technology legal scholars meeting technologists got ta kind whole layers around alluded emerging engineering field big part electrical engineering came one around time plug electricity walls kinds work like underwriters laboratory reassured plug going burn house machine everything whole people install things people watch installers whole layers know onion kinds things things deep interesting privacy least interesting electricity going take decades kind work going require lot new structures right kind hard talk saying lot money made get right something look lot money made things provide human services people recognize useful parts lives yeah yeah dialogue sometimes goes exuberant technologists technology good kind know public discourse know far see much kind thing sober discussions middle challenge wants need conversations know actually many forum fora know kind would look maybe could go could read comment section something would actually kind dialogue going back forth see much right actually resurgence podcasts people really hungry conversation technology helping much comment sections anything including youtube hurting helping\",\n          \"becoming cyborgs brains fundamentally changed everyone grew electronics fundamentally different previous homo sapiens call us homo techno think evolved homo techno like essentially new species previous technologies mean may even profound moved us certain degree think computers make us homo techno think brain augmentation like allows actual evolution like computers accelerate degree technologies also accelerated would classify homo sapien homo techno definitely homo techno one earliest species think us following conversation grimes artist musician songwriter producer director fascinating human thinks lot history future human civilization studying dark periods past help form optimistic vision future lex friedman podcast support please check sponsors description dear friends grimes oh yeah cloud lifter go go know stuff ever used cloud lifter yeah actually microphone cloud lifter michael jackson used really yeah like thriller stuff mic cloud lifter yeah incredible microphone flattering vocals used lot great demo vocals great room sometimes easier record vocals room music playing wan na feel headphones mic pretty directional think good mic vibing getting real good vocal take vibing room anyway michael jackson quincy jones microphone feel way badass right wan na get guess right one names least space time c like letter told c means lot things speed light render rate universe yes spanish crescent moon happens favorite programming language basically runs world also powerful fast dangerous mess things really bad pointers anyway associations name c coolest mean coolest speed light obviously speed light say render rate universe think mean speed light essentially rendering see think know simulation speed light changes improve render speed well already pretty good already pretty good improves know probably like okay updated upgraded well fast enough us humans seems immediate delay latency terms us humans earth interacting things like intergalactic species operating much larger scale gon na start noticing weird stuff operate like around black hole gon na start see render issues ca go faster speed light correct really limits ability one ability travel space theoretically wormholes nothing general relativity precludes faster speed light travel seems gon na really funky stuff heavy things like weirdnesses basically terrors space time know navigators know navigators yeah folding space basically making wormholes name yes think multiple people one person know like morning different person tonight say recording basically midnight awesome yes thank much think eight hours late right time good morning beginning new day soon anyway person morning evening multiple people think one person maybe clue giant mystery okay really intense questions let go let go asked like look mirror people tell even mean mean think personality changes everyone talk inconsistent personality yeah person person interaction personality materializes mood like go like megalomaniac like know like total hermit shy combinatorial combination mood person interacting yeah mood people interacting think everyone like maybe well everybody acknowledges able introspect brings kind person kind mood brings best artist human introspect like best friends like people like super confident know gon na understand everything saying like best friends start really funny always like peak mode like yeah takes lot get let talk constraints talked constraints limits help artist human get way like constraints creating music creating art living life like constraints world puts hate constraints moving good right like like progressing technology changing constraints like artistic creation know making video music stuff getting lot cheaper constantly new technology new software making faster easier much freedom like michael jackson know recorded thriller microphone like use mixing desk stuff like probably even get studio probably really expensive really good singer know use like mixing desk everything know make made whole album computer lot freedom also constrained different ways like literally millions artists like much bigger playing field like also learn music natural musician know anything actual music know like computer really kind like messing around like trying things well yeah mean nature music changing saying know actual music music changing music becoming talked becoming like merging technology yes becoming something like notes piano becoming weird composition requires engineering skills programming skills kind human robot interaction skills still things michael jackson like good ear good sense taste good final thing put together like allowed enabled empowered laptop layer stuff start like layering insane amounts stuff super easy think music production really underrated art form feel like people really appreciate look publishing splits way people like pay producers stuff super producers deeply underrated like many songs popular right last years like part reason popular production really interesting really sick really cool like think listeners like people really understand music production sort like weird discombobulated art form like formal new like formal training path mostly driven like autodidacts like like almost everyone know good production like go music school anything taught mostly different like music producers know commonalities time together different kinds weirdos cause hung rick rubin know yeah mean rick rubin like literally one gods music production like one people first know like made music production know made production important actual lyrics notes thing interesting know speak hanging seems sit silence close eyes listen like almost nothing nothing somehow gives freedom best version music production somehow like encouraging less simplify like push towards minimalism mean guess mean work differently rick rubin cause rick rubin produces artists whereas like mostly produce different situation also think rick rubin would say advanced category producer like like earned engineer stuff people like stuff usually like stuff engineer producer artist yeah guess would say era like post rick rubin era like come kind like skrillex school thought like yeah engineer producer artist like mean lately sometimes work producer gently sort delicately starting collaborate bit like think kind like whatever explosion things everything became available computer kind got like lone wizard energy thing going embraced loneliness loneliness somehow engine creativity like stuff creative quote unquote genius quotes privacy mind yes well thing talking daniel eck said like artists years like good years usually stop making like vital shit feel like sort like nearing end years become somebody else like process becoming somebody else reinventing work people never worked people find make like exceptionally rejuvenated making like vital work ever made think another human brain like one best tools possibly find like funny way put love like tool like know whatever hp plus one like adds like stats character like another human brain like square instead like adding something double experience points love also mention playing tavern music love first think first stop tavern music yeah audio okay okay makes yeah make podcast annoying add post add post one want listen podcast probably would makes reminds like video game like role playing video game experience points something really joyful wandering places like elder scrolls like skyrim exploring landscapes another world get experience points work different skills somehow progress life know simple messy complexities life usually bad guy fight skyrim dragons sure elden ring bunch monsters fight love feel like elden ring feel like good analogy music production though like feel like engineers people creating open worlds sort like similar people music producers like hidden archetype like one really understands one really knows like like artist engineer like art fairly complex engineering well saying get enough credit kind changing becoming person everything engineer well mean others gone know like timbaland skrillex people like know famous think general think people get confused really know per se see song like like hit song like trying think like going like even basic pop hit like like rules dua lipa something production actually like really crazy mean song also great like production exceptionally memorable like know like one ca even know produced song like part like rhetoric discuss creation art sort like consider music producer think music producer used simply recording things yeah interesting think movies talk actor actresses also talk directors talk like music often beatles music producer one first kind guy one first people sort introducing crazy sound design pop music forget name forget name know like weird stuff like dropping pianos like yeah oh get yeah yeah yeah get sound get authentic sound lyrics think fit important heartbroken learn elvis write songs mad lot people write songs understand thing feel like desire authenticity used like really mad like people would write produce music like fake realized like weird bitterness like agronus art authenticity kind like weird realization recently started thinking like art sort decentralized collective thing like art kind conversation artists ever lived know like like really sort like anyone reinventing wheel like kind taking know thousands years art like running little algorithm like making interpretation joined conversation artists came beautiful way look like like feel like everyone always like copyright ip authenticity like think need stop seeing like egotistical thing like oh creative genius lone creative genius like think art think art something sort brings humanity together also art also kind collective memory humans like give fuck whatever ancient egypt like much grain got sent day sending records like know like went know many shields needed produced like remember art like know like day day life stuff seems important art helps us function survive gone like thing really gon na left art technology obsolete fascinating like humans dead true good compression human history art generated across different centuries different millennia aliens come aliens come gon na find hieroglyphics pyramids mean art could broadly defined might find like engineering marvels bridges rockets guess sort classify though architecture art consider engineering formats art sure sucks like digital art easier delete apocalypse nuclear war disappear yes physical something still valuable physical manifestation art sucks like music example played somebody yeah think foundation type situation like know like seed banks north stuff like probably like solar powered geothermal little bunker like human knowledge mentioned daniel ek spotify think artist spotify empowering spotify consumer super exciting makes easy access music kinds artists get explore kinds music make super easy sort curate playlist fun liberating let go know used collect know albums cds like horde albums yeah like matter reality could know really liberating could let go letting go albums kind collecting allows find new music exploring new artists kind stuff know perspective artist could like mentioned competition could kind constraint artists platform think better artists mean might propaganda conversation daniel ek could easily propaganda victim somebody propaganda let accept daniel ek telling know understand really difficult concepts different way like emotional intelligence something deep within oh yeah like x hurts like x bites really hard like ow like gets sad like sad hurts accident yeah huge hurts lot accident yeah interesting mind emerges children really memory time ca even conversation yeah thank god memory time like think like mean youngest baby like like like read sci fi short story mouth must scream good title oh man mean read mouth must scream hate getting rocco basilisk shit kind story like ai like torturing someone eternity like body way describe sort sounds like feels like like baby like conscious getting inputs everywhere muscles like jelly like ca move try like communicate ca communicate like like like hell state think good ca remember like little baby exiting like starting like get muscles like autonomy like watching go opening phase like like seem good oh think kind like like think sucks think might really violent like violent mentally violent psychologically violent consciousness emerging think violent thing never thought think possible carry quite bit trauma think would good thing study think think addressing trauma like think might oh mean like echoes still shadows somewhere think got ta feel help helplessness like existential like fear like unknown place bombarded inputs completely helpless like got ta somewhere deep brain ca good think consciousness whole conversation impossibly difficult questions think debbie said like hard yeah talked music like two minutes right music music yeah still like purpose love music mean music greatest thing ever favorite thing like every interview like process like know done ca anything want ask able live oh tell ableton ableton sick one ever asked ableton though yeah well need tech support mainly help help ableton tech anyway ableton back consciousness think thing humans capable robots conscious like think entities think aliens conscious like conscious consciousness terrence mckenna quote found fucking love allowed swear yes nature loves courage make commitment nature respond commitment removing impossible obstacles dream impossible dream world grind lift trick teachers philosophers really counted really touched alchemical gold understood shamanic dance waterfall magic done hurling abyss discovering feather bed yeah reason think technological limits think like already happening like impossible insane done limited amount time accelerating rate think digital consciousness inevitable may able even understand means like hurling abyss surrounded mystery keep hurling like fearlessly keep discovering cool shit yeah like think like like even knows laws physics laws physics probably current like saying speed light current render rate like simulation able upgrade like sort suspect made james webb telescope like part reason made upgrade know space rendered see yeah think humans super super super limited cognitively wonder allowed create intelligent beings see universe render rate upgraded maybe cognitively limited everyone keeps talking cognitively limited ai gon na render us obsolete like know like thing like amoeba becoming alligator like like create ai intelligent design literally religions based gods create consciousness like god making like incredibly profound like even ca compute even much worse like like unfathomably worse like know omnipotent kind ai like think would think stupid think would recognize profundity accomplished gods gods personality mean kind guy complicated complicated like would acknowledge value well hope acknowledge value paying respect creative ancestors think would think cool think curiosity trait quantify put ai think ai curious curious us hateful dismissive us might know see us know like like oh fuck dogs let kill dogs love dogs dogs great utility dogs like provide lot make friends deep connection anthropomorphize like real love dogs cats reason even though intellectually much less us think something sacred us like look universe like whole universe like cold dead sort robotic like know ai intelligence know kind like universe like cold know logical know abiding laws physics whatever like like loosey goosey weird art thing happened think beautiful like think even think one values

know think magic limitations constraints within hormones kind stuff finiteness life get given limitations get come creative solutions dance around limitations partner like penguins cold fall love love ultimately kind allows us delude mortal finite life ultimately live alone born alone die alone love like moment long time forgetting come creative hacks make life like fascinatingly fun yeah yeah yeah fun yeah ai might different kinds fun yes hopefully funs intersect think would little intersection fun yeah yeah think role love human condition think useful useful like hack like fundamental means human capacity love mean think love evolutionary mechanism like beginning intelligent design like reading know kropotkin like anarchist like old russian anarchist live next door michael malice know know anarchist modern day anarchist okay anarchists fun kind getting anarchism little bit probably good route taking oh think listen expose ideas harm thinking ideas think anarchists challenge systems interesting ways think interesting ways good soul like refreshes mental palette think actually would actually ascribe never actually gone deep anarchy philosophy still think though read listen reading russian revolution lot soviets lenin kropotkin anarchist sect sort interesting kind technocrat actually like women equal appliances really using technology reduce amount work people kropotkin biologist something studied animals really time like think nature magazine think might even started russian magazine publishing studies everyone really darwinism time survival fittest war mechanism become better real cementing idea society violence kill weak become better kropotkin kind interesting looking instances finding instances nature animals like helping stuff like actually love survival mechanism like many instances animal kingdom like cooperation like helping weaker creatures stuff actually evolutionary mechanism mean even look child rearing like child rearing like immense amounts love goodwill like immediate getting immediate feedback like winning competitive literally like actually use love evolutionary mechanism much use war think like missing part reoriented culturally reoriented like science philosophy oriented around darwinism little bit much kropotkin model think equally valid like like cooperation love stuff essential species survival evolution powerful survival mechanism context evolution comes back like think engineering much important motherhood like lose motherhood engineering means nothing humans like think society survival way see conceptualize evolution really change also include idea guess yeah weird thing seems irrational also core means human love one thing could make lot irrational things depth connection loyalty powerful thing irrational rational like like know maybe losing things order like keep family together order like like actual values well right mean rational thing cold economist perspective know motherhood sacrificing career love know terms salary terms economic wellbeing terms flourishing human could seen kind metrics irrational decision suboptimal decision manifestation love could optimal thing kind saying save one life save world thing doctors often face like well considered irrational profit model include social good yes yeah profit model includes social good suddenly would rational decisions might difficult know requires shift thinking profit might difficult measure social good yes learning measure lot things yeah digitizing lot things actually know quantifying vision stuff like like know like go facebook like facebook pretty much predict behaviors like surprising amount things seem like mysterious consciousness soul things quantified point surely quantify things yeah us moving digital space wanted ask something fan perspective kind know musician online personality seems like identities play one cool things internet seems like play identities move digital world maybe even called metaverse mean love metaverse love idea like way played go well people mad think need like think temporary think temporary like know celebrities got together sang song imagine jeff leonard everyone started hating song imagine hoping temporary damn good song think temporary like actually virtual worlds whatever called metaverse otherwise becomes know well virtual worlds like video games elden ring played elden ring played elden ring really afraid playing game literally amazed looks way fun looks would wan na go stay forever yeah fun nice oh man yeah yeah metaverse metaverse really immersive sense three dimension like virtual reality integration necessary really take close eyes kind plug screen become time really enjoy journey take almost become longer c longer lex creature whatever hell game yeah mean love video games really become people time like seems like idea metaverse idea digital space well even twitter get chance somebody prolonged periods time like across lifespan know twitter account years decades person know good thing feel tormented twitter specifically social media representation feel like public perception gotten distorted find kind disturbing one things disincentivizing like wanting keep making art like completely lost control narrative narrative stupidity lot like like hijacked forces far beyond control kind got head things like random indian

things burdens useful burden useful burden yeah sure wan na understand evil psychopathy fake twitter accounts go different algorithmic bubbles try understand keep getting fights people realize actually fighting think used exist monoculture social media stuff kinda got fed thing speaking cultural language think recently one things diagnosing properly enough social media different dialects many different dialects chinese becoming different dialects english realizing people saying exact things using completely different verbiage punishing using correct verbiage completely misunderstanding people misunderstanding people saying got fight friend anarchism communism shit two hours end conversation say something like literally saying like like fuck different like english way understanding terminology like drastically like algorithm bubbles creating mini dialects language interpreted language used fascinating like arguments need polarization happening need happening

differently cool also cool yeah dan carlin retelling history way retelling history think exciting history way thinking history think dan carlin one people like dan carlin one people really started getting excited like revolutionizing education like dan carlin instilled already like really liked history instilled like obsessive love history point like fucking reading like going bed reading like part four rise fall third reich whatever like got like dense ass history like like opened door like made want scholar topic like like feel like good teacher like know sort made feel like one things could education like find like world great teachers like create passion topic autodidactricism know say properly like self teaching like much faster lectured like much efficient sort like able teach ask teacher questions know like know like university stuff like learn much material much faster lot learning going teachers get stuck like teachers inspire passion topic think one invaluable skills whole species like like ai like ai going teach much efficiently teach needed get point teach finds motivation right yeah like inspire yeah could teach make fact mentioned rise fall third reich read yeah read twice read twice yes okay one even knows yeah like wait thought like super poppin book super pop yeah like far interesting yeah written person important kind know start like could possibly happen read rise fall third reich like people tried really hard happen people tried almost reinstated monarchy one point try stop happening like almost like abandoned democracy try get happen least way makes feel bunch small moments history turn yes like small meetings yes human interactions terrifying inspiring like even attempts assassinating hitler like time time failed close like operation valkyrie good also role really heavy burden geopolitical perspective role leaders see evil truly becomes evil anticipate stand evil evil actually pretty rare world scale hitler tend know modern discourse kind call people evil quickly look ancient history like ton hitlers actually think norm like going back like sort intelligent design theory think one things successfully slow move survival fittest intelligent design kind eradicating like look like ancient assyria stuff like shit like brutal like heads like brutal like genghis khan like genocide genocide like throwing plague bodies walls decimating whole cities like muslim conquests like damascus shit like people cities used get leveled fucking time okay get bronze age collapse basically like almost like roman level like society like like world like global trade like everything awesome mix think bit climate change development iron basically bronze could come way make bronze like everything funneled one iranian mine like one supply chain one things makes worried supply chains think need thoughtful think biggest issue society right like thing likely go wrong probably supply chain collapse war climate change whatever like anything causes supply chain collapse population big handle like thing seems cause dark ages mass supply chain collapse bronze age collapse happened like sort like ancient collapse happened like literally like ancient egypt cities everything got like decimated destroyed abandoned cities like hundreds like flourishing society like almost coming modernity everything got leveled mini dark ages like little writing recording time like lot information bronze age collapse basically equivalent like medieval medieval dark ages happened know years like thousands years earlier sort like recovered bronze age collapse empire reemerged writing trade everything reemerged course contemporary dark ages time designed mechanism lessen lessen capability destructive power centers emerge recording contemporary dark ages think like better understanding avoid still think high risk think one big risks right natural state humans lot hitlers gotten really good making hard emerge gotten better collaboration resisting power like authoritarians come power trying go country country like moving past kind like slowly incrementally like moving towards like scary old school war stuff think seeing happen countries least nominally like supposed moved past scary reminds us happen like places moved supposedly hopefully moved past possibly civilization level like said supply chain collapse might make people resource constraint might make people desperate angry hateful violent drag us right back mean supply chain collapse like ultimate thing caused middle ages supply chain collapse like people people reliant certain level technology like people like look like britain like glass like people aqueducts people like indoor heating cooling like running water like buy food world trade markets like people know hunt forage gather similar situation educated enough survive without technology supply chain collapse like limits access technology like massive starvation violence displacement war like know like yeah opinion like primary marker like dark age well technology kind enabling us resilient terms supply chain terms different catastrophic events happened us although pandemic kind challenged preparedness catastrophic think coolest invention humans come wheel fire cooking meat computers computers freaking computers internet computers one think previous technologies mean may even profound moved us certain degree think computers make us homo tech think brain augmentation like allows actual evolution like computers accelerate degree technologies also accelerated would classify homo sapien homo techno definitely homo techno one earliest species think us like said like think like looked brain scans us versus humans hundred years ago would look different think physiologically different even interaction devices changed brains well look lot studies coming show like degree inherited memory physiological changes theory passing like know like instance physiological change gon na fizzle theory progress like offspring speaking offspring advice would give young person like high school whether artist creative engineer kind career path maybe life general live life proud think one big thoughts like especially kids think spend enough time teaching creativity think creativity muscle like things lot emphasis know learn play piano write song like learn technical stuff thing think like friend like world greatest guitar player like know amazing sort like producer works people really sort like know like engineers records things like solos really like make music talking like dude talented music like make music whatever like cause got old never learned creative muscle like know embarrassing like learning creative muscle takes lot failure also sort creative know throwing paint wall lot stuff fail like part like tolerance failure humiliation somehow easier develop young persist young everything easier develop young yes younger better could destroy mean shitty thing creativity know failure could destroy careful risk worth taking also young age developing tolerance failure good fail time like stupid shit time like public private get canceled make kinds mistakes like resilient making mistakes like lot things like people would like think greatest asset creativity like think pain like tolerance failure super essential thing taught things brilliant advice yeah yeah wish everybody encouraged sort failure opposed kind cause like punish failure like like teaching kids like wrong like know like x keeps like like wrong know met came furious spotify like grilled super hard got answers saying like sort peak cd industry like artists making millions millions dollars like like tiny kind spotify kind democratized industry think said million artists making good living spotify heard like honestly would rather make less money like decent living artists able even though like wish could include everyone yeah really hard argue youtube youtube mission want basically many creators possible make living kind living hard argue hard think better ways manager actually wish like would brought manager building app manage like help organize percentages get publishing dah dah dah dah dah take middlemen much bigger like automate get automate manager automate management publishing legal read app building read contract like tell one issues music right getting paid enough art industry filled middlemen artists good business beginning like frank sinatra mob stuff like music industry run business people artists artists really get small cuts like make think part reason technocrat mean fans gon na technocrats one gon na mad like fans hate say kind thing general public like technocrats like technocrats like watched battle angel alita like martian technocracy like yeah martian technocracy like evil like oh okay like cause martian technocracy sounds sick yeah intuition technocrats would create kind beautiful world example manager working create app removes need lawyer could smart contracts blockchain removes need like management organizing stuff like read stuff explain collect royalties know like small amounts amount money getting spotify actually means lot goes lot farther remove bureaucracy inefficiencies make life great could yeah think issue enough like issue inefficiency really positive sum mindset know win win mindset like instead know fighting scraps make worrying scarcity like instead scarcity mindset increase efficiency know way expand size pie let ask experimentation said beautiful musician like conversation came much creating music like kind conversation trying fit cultural trends much like trying much possible outsider come something totally new like thinking experimenting trying totally different totally weird trying fit man hard feel like kind process semi retiring music like old brain yeah bring like shelf put table couple minutes poke think bit think forcing engage new music really great neuroplasticity like think know people part reason music marketed young people young people neuroplastic like like whatever gon na really easy love new music older gets harder harder harder think one beautiful things musician constantly force listen new music think keeps brain really plastic think really good exercise think everyone listen new music hate think keep force like okay well people like like know make brain form new neural pathways open change really brilliant actually sorry interrupt like exercise really amazing sort embrace change embrace sort practice neuroplasticity like one things fall love certain band kind stay rest life never understand modern music really good exercise streaming spotify like classic rock stuff like new music makes small chunk played spotify think like good sign us species think yeah good measure species open mindedness change often listen new music brain let put music brain back shelf got ta pull futurist brain second wild ways think future say like years maybe years maybe hundred years different current way life earth talk augmented reality virtual reality maybe robots maybe space travel maybe video games maybe genetic engineering keep going cyborgs aliens world wars maybe destructive nuclear wars good bad think future imagining weirdest wildest could read surface detail iain banks surface detail favorite depiction oh wow read book literally greatest science fiction book possibly ever written iain banks man yeah sure read player games read titles ca copyrighted steal like player games sick nice yeah name album like always wanted romeo juliet something always wanted name album war peace nice like would like good good heard like could also things public domain people clue song called player games yes oh yeah iain banks surface detail opinion best future ever read heard science fiction basically relationship super intelligence like artificial super intelligence like great want credit person coined term love term feel like young women get enough credit yeah go protopia futures instagram name personalized donor experience scale ai power donor experience monica bealskite saying wrong probably gon na probably butchering bit protopia sort utopia unattainable protopia sort like know wow awesome instagram protopia futures great future know good get future positive future ai centralized ai surface detail distributed kind ai mostly exist giant super ships like sort like guild ships dune like giant ships kind move people around ships sentient talk passengers mean lot different types ai banksyan future opening scene surface detail place called culture culture basically protopian future protopian future think like future like obviously utopia perfect like cause like striving utopia think feels hopeless sort like maybe best terminology using like pretty good place like mostly like know super intelligence biological beings exist fairly harmony much war like close equality get know like approximately good future like really awesome stuff opening scene girl born sex slave outside culture society adhere cultural values tries kill guy like master kills unbeknownst traveling ship culture like say like crazy things like x keeps like like bubble car bubble car like know like bubble car like like like want like wrong like thinking weird crazy shit like know bubble car like creating worlds might internally consistent might discover something fundamental world yeah like rewrite songs like words prefers like instead baby shark says baby car like maybe onto something let ask big ridiculous question kind dancing around think meaning whole thing human civilization life earth general life meaning life read nova scene yet james lovelock lot really good book recommendations even finished huge fraud yet like really early book says amazing thing like feel like everyone sad cynical like everyone like fermi paradox everyone keep hearing people like fuck alone like oh ah like ah ah like okay like wait beginning like nova scene says gon na correct ca like memorize quotes says something like consciousness like right like universe waking like instead discovering universe universe like evolution literal universe like separate universe like universe waking universe seeing first time like universe becoming conscious first time part yeah cause like separate universe like could like incredibly sacred moment maybe like social media things stuff getting connected together like maybe neurons connecting like collective super intelligence waking yeah like know like maybe instead something cynical maybe something discover like maybe know blast assist like incredible kind consciousness like first three years life human children forget suffering going think probably forget mean probably know artificial intelligence eventually render us obsolete think malicious way think probably weak sun expanding like know like hopefully get mars like pretty vulnerable know like think coexist long time ai also probably make less vulnerable know think consciousness sentience self awareness like think might single greatest like moment evolution ever like maybe know big like true beginning life blue green algae like single celled organisms something amazing universe awakens yeah well see incredible person fascinating mind definitely friend liv mentioned guys thinking maybe talking would love explored mind kind media podcast kind way awesome person honor know honor get sit late night like surreal really enjoyed thank talking today yeah mean huge honor feel underqualified big fan listening podcast lot yeah liv would appreciate advice help definitely gon na yeah anytime thank cool thank thanks listening conversation grimes support podcast please check sponsors description let leave words oscar wilde yes dreamer dreamer one find way moonlight punishment sees dawn rest world thank listening hope see next time one day ship put neural lace head neural lace sort like basically neuralink life imitates art indeed indeed wakes opening scene memory uploaded neural lace killed gets choose new body ai interfacing recorded memory neural lace helping like hello dead neural lace memory uploaded want choose new body going born culture like start new life like opening like sick ship super intelligence ships kind super intelligence still want preserve kind rich fulfilling experience humans yeah like like friends humans bunch ships want exist biological beings place like way thing necessarily pretty protopian existence pretty peaceful yeah mean example one main fights book fighting artificial hells people think ethical artificial hell like basically people crime get sent like die memory gets sent artificial hell eternally tortured way society deciding whether artificial hell simulated like simulated war instead actual blood know people basically essentially fighting video game choose outcome still experiencing suffering artificial hell experience stuff artificial hell sucks lot people culture want get rid artificial hell simulated wars happening artificial hell simulated wars happening outside artificial hell political factions political faction says simulated hell deter crime political faction saying simulated hell unethical instead like know blowing nukes like giant fortnite battle decide know protopia like okay war without death know think simulated hells think definitely one ways technology could go wrong almost punishing people digital space something like yeah like torturing people memories either deterrent like committed crime also personal pleasure sick demented humans world dan carlin actually episode hardcore history painful attainment oh episode fucked dark kind goes human history says like humans seem enjoy secretly enjoy used openly enjoy sort torture death watching death torture humans think people consenting allowed gladiatorial matches consent hard achieve situations always starts getting slippery like could also forced consent like starts getting weird way much excitement like highlights something human nature wants see violence really dark hope sort overcome aspect human nature still within us somewhere well think right theory important current moment evolution survival fittest point lines kind fuzzy recent past maybe even right getting point choose intelligent design like probably since like integration iphone like becoming cyborgs like brains fundamentally changed everyone grew electronics fundamentally different previous homo sapiens call us homo techno think evolved homo techno like essentially new species like look way took mri brain took mri like medieval brain think would different way evolved think historians look back time see like fundamental shift human think think still homo sapiens believe homo techno think evolved think right way evolving choose think reckless like social media think idea like time choose intelligent design taken seriously like moment reprogram human computer like go blind visual cortex get taken functions choose evolution change way brains work actually huge responsibility think sure responsible definitely adequate education inundated technology fundamentally changing physical structure brains adequately responding choose wan na evolve could evolve could really whatever want think really important time think choose correctly choose wisely consciousness could exist long time integration ai could extremely positive think enough people focusing specific situation think might irreversibly screw things get things wrong flip side seems humans pretty adaptive maybe way figure things screwing like social media generation see negative effects social media build new social medias keep improving stuff learn failures past humans seem really adaptive flip side get wrong way literally create weapons war increase hate past certain threshold really lot damage mean think optimized notice negative things would actually say one things think people noticing look silicon valley look technocracy like happening silicon valley started facebook profit crap really particular guess useful sort whatever see lab grown meat compostable biodegradable single use cutlery meditation apps think actually evolving changing technology changing think maybe quite enough education also know quite enough incentive think way capitalism works define profit also working old model define profit really think changed idea profit include social good economic profit social good also counting profit would incentivize things useful whatever spiritual technology positive technology things help reprogram human computer good way things help us intelligently design new brains yeah reason within framework capitalism word profit idea profit ca also incorporate well human like long term well long term happiness even example talking motherhood like part reason late get baby bed like keep thinking motherhood capitalism like extremely essential job difficult compensated sort like value things much compensate really devalue motherhood society pretty much societies like capitalism recognize motherhood job supposed free like feel like producing great humans seen great profit capitalism like like huge social good like every awesome human gets made adds much world like integrated profit structure know potentially found way compensate motherhood come compensation much broader money could money like made know know pay like mean start getting reallocation resources people get upset well like made like motherhood dow yeah yeah know used fund like single mothers like know pay making babies mean create put beautiful things onto world could companies bridges could art could lot things could children education anything valued society somehow incorporated framework market like contribute children world valued respected sort celebrated like proportional thing fuels human civilization yeah like kind important feel like everyone always saying mean think different social spheres everyone always saying like dismantle capitalism like well okay well think government everything like think private ownership like scary know like starts getting weird stuff sort like feel almost way without police state know obviously capitalism major flaws think actually mac showed idea called social capitalism form capitalism like considers social good also profit like know like right companies need like supposed grow every quarter whatever like show functioning well like okay well kept amount profit still green also social good like really need extra economic growth could add social good counts know know economist idea could achieved think economists know anything could achieved either pretend thing construct model go tv shows sound like expert definition economist mother becoming mother change human would say man think kind changed everything still changing lot actually changing right moment like today like like recent months stuff elucidate change like wake morning look become different would say think really reorienting priorities first really fighting somehow felt like failure feminism something like felt like like bad like kids started mattering work like recently started sort analyzing thought like also kind construct like devalued motherhood much culture like feel guilty caring kids care work feminism includes breaking whatever construct continually breaking like freedom empower free means also like mother like much creative like believe massive amount brain growth think cause like stakes higher somehow think like trippy watching consciousness emerge like like going crazy journey something like craziest science fiction novel could ever read crazy watching consciousness come time like forced value time much like creative time sacred need like really fricking thing used like cynic used wan na like last album called miss anthropocene like like like study villainy like like well instead old gods like new gods like miss anthropocene like misanthrope like anthropocene like know like goddess climate change whatever like destroying world like like dark like study villainy sort like like used like problem making cynical angry scary art anything wrong think kids makes optimist inherently makes wan na optimist bad like feel responsibility make optimistic things get lot shit everyone like oh privileged stop talking like pie sky stupid concepts focus like like think ideate futures could good wo able get everything blade runner gon na end blade runner like said earlier life imitates art like life really imitate art really need protopian utopian art think incredibly essential future humanity think current discourse seen thinking protopia utopia seen dismissal problems currently think incorrect mindset like kids makes wan na imagine amazing futures like maybe wo able build able build want yeah seem like ideation precursor creation imagine order able build sad thing human nature somehow cynical view world seen insightful view know cynicism often confused insight sad see optimism confused naivete yes yes like blinded maybe privilege whatever blinded something certainly blinded sad sad see seems like optimists ones create future ones build order build crazy thing optimistic either stupid excited passionate mad enough actually believe built people built favorite quote time star wars episode know everyone hates like star wars episode yeah probably would say would probably hate yeah strong feelings let backtrack strong feelings star wars tolkien person dragons orcs ogres yeah mean tolkien forever really want one son call thought tao tecno tolkien would cool lot like yeah well tao six two eight two pi yeah tao tecno yeah yeah yeah techno obviously best genre music also like technocracy sounds really good yeah right techno tolkien tao tecno tolkien good tao tecno tolkien star wars episode know lot people issues personally record think best star

sided like gon na go kill like gon na get stabbed like think talk nexus point point society switching intelligent design think part switch intelligent design need choose nonviolence need like think choose start think eradicate violence species think need little bit think choose really reorient primitive brains fighting scarcity attack oriented move optimize creativity building yeah interesting think happens education living life introspecting mind trying live better angels nature one us kinds things scale sort start minimize amount destructive war world probably technology really promising way like social media really promising way way connect know part really enjoy social media know negative stuff engage negative stuff even like blocking kind stuff letting enter mind like like somebody says something negative see immediately think positive thoughts forget exist move like negative energy return negative energy going get excited negative way right back kind vicious cycle would think technology would assist us process letting go taking things personally engaging negativity unfortunately social media profits negativity current models mean social media like gun like take course use like like mean like say reprogram human computer like school learn social media optimizes know raise cortisol levels make angry crazy stressed like learn hygiene use social media yeah choose focus negative stuff know sure social media guess exist sure mean messy experimental phase like working yeah early days even know say social media know even means early days think social media basic human

simply small subset reason ca build arbitrarily great intelligences yeah think intelligence way intelligence tricky definition offhand remember panel discussion saw youtube seth lloyd panel martin rees famous astrophysicist seth gave shtick universe computer explained martin rees said computer seth like oh good question sure sufficiently broad definition computer everything right simile analogy gains force excludes things know moon going around earth performing computation come definitions answer yes useful computation think absolutely helpful think universe certain situations certain contexts information processing device even guilty writing paper called quantum circuit cosmology modeled whole universe quantum circuit circuit circuit yeah qubits kind thing qubits basically right yeah qubits becoming entangled wan na digress little bit let kind fun mystery universe deep profound nobody talks space expands right talk certain region space certain number degrees freedom certain number ways quantum fields particles region arrange number degrees freedom region space arguably finite actually know many good argument says finite number universe expands space gets bigger degrees freedom infinite number really matter infinity times two still infinity finite number space degrees freedom come would mean universe closed system degrees freedom popping existence suggested degrees freedom start entangled start universe know three dimensions around us see said entangled degrees freedom making space time universe expands whole bunch qubits zero state become entangled rest space time action quantum circuits mean degrees freedom become entangled yeah universe expands right degrees freedom entangled playing part playing role part entangled space time structure basic underlying philosophy space time arises entanglement fundamental quantum degrees freedom wow okay point entanglement happening talking close big bang talking throughout time life throughout history yeah idea big bang almost degrees freedom universe could unentangled anything else reflection fact big bang low entropy simple small place space expands degrees freedom become entangled rest world well ask john carroll think thought experiment nick bostrom living simulation think let contextualize little bit think people actually take thought experiments think quite interesting useful quite interesting perspective ai lot learning done usually happens simulation artificial examples constructive question ask difficult real world simulate right kind dual part living simulation somebody built simulation try hard would obviously could living simulation want physical possibility completely agree physically possible think actually take one piece data consideration know live big universe okay two trillion galaxies observable universe billion stars galaxy et cetera would seem waste resources universe big going simulation words want good bayesian want ask hypothesis expect see first thing would say would expect see universe big okay second thing would expect resolution universe good always possible superhuman simulators finite resources render entire universe right part two trillion galaxies actually simulated fully okay obvious extrapolation simulated fully like rest non player characters right thing real rest chat bots beyond wall see wall literally nothing side wall sort bayesian prediction would like efficient simulation like none seems quite realistic see hear argument possible easy simulate lots things see evidence know universe look like simulated universe maybe say well know would look like abandoning bayesian responsibilities like job say theory would expect see yeah certainly think simulation thing like video game small subset rendered say entire laws physics entire closed system quote unquote universe creator yeah always possible right useful think thinking physics way nick bostrom phrases possible simulate universe eventually right use way lot things well yeah guess question hard create universe wrote little blog post maybe missing something argument says might possible simulate universe probably imagine actually attribute consciousness agency little things simulating little artificial beings probably lot ordinary organic beings universe future right argument simulation possible probable space living consciousnesses simulated right top level think argument must wrong follows argument simulated also simulate things well simulate things simulate things right give enough power resolution ultimately reach bottom laws physics universe bottom made atoms forth cheapest possible simulations believe original argument conclude cheapest possible simulation people look like look like edge resolution bit things seems much easier make much lower level things also questioned whole approach anthropic principle says typical observers universe think actually think lot selection typical within things already know typical within universe think intelligent life however would like define intelligent life universe guess intelligent life observable universe us simply basis fact likely number intelligent species observable universe two likely numbers zero billions billions would noticed already literally like small number like know star trek dozen intelligent civilizations galaxy billion weird sort bizarre easy imagine zero others big bottleneck making multicellular life technological life whatever hard imagine whole bunch somehow remained hidden us question like ask would intelligent life look like mean question going intelligent life big ways different one earth kinds intelligent life operates different scales size temporal right great possibility think humble intelligence life even agree life much less intelligent life right argument humility saying could intelligent life different character right like could imagine dolphins intelligent never invent space travel live ocean thumbs right never invent technology never invent smelting maybe universe full intelligent species make technology right compatible data think think maybe pointing even versions intelligence intelligence intermolecular clouds surface neutron star galaxies giant things equivalent heartbeat million years one hand yes open minded things hand us share laws physics might something laws physics even though currently know exactly thing would makes meters years right length timescales intelligent life maybe made atoms atoms certain size orbit stars stars certain lifetime impossible sweet spot intelligent life find open minded either way open minded either humble sorts different kinds life reason know yet life like kind life yeah two minds often wonder brains designed quite obviously operate see world timescales almost blind tools created detecting things blind kind observation needed see intelligent life scales well totally open another argument would make looked intelligent life looked dumbest way turning radio telescopes sky world would super advanced civilization randomly beam radio signals wastefully directions universe make sense especially order think would actually contact another civilization would forever keep millions years sounds like waste resources thought solar systems planets around maybe intelligent life yet exist might someday would try talk radio waves would send spacecraft would park around would like point view like monolith monolith could artifact fact way works also right could artifacts solar system put technologically advanced civilizations eventually contact explored solar system well enough yet find reason think young impatient right like would take lifetime actually send something another star system wait come back start thinking hundreds thousands years million year time scales clearly right thing excited thing elon musk spacex general space idea space exploration even though species young impatient yeah think space travel crucially important long term even star systems think many people overestimate difficulty say look travel speed light another star system dead get right think much easier therefore write science fiction stories imagine go faster speed light otherwise impatient right gon na go faster speed light could easily imagine human lifespan gets extended thousands years stars much closer effectively right hundred year trip right think gon na future far future lifetime baby steps unless lifetime gets extended well race time right friend mine actually thinks things said know gon na die know grandchildren know predicting future hard least plausible scenario yeah think discussed earlier threats earth known unknown right spread humanity biology elsewhere really important longterm goal kind questions science currently answer might soon think problems mysteries us may within reach science think obvious one origin life know happened difficulty knowing happened historically actually know literally earth starting life non life something kind think close right really really think like difficult start life well talked people including podcast know life requires three things life know difference life knows life know talk intelligence life know requires compartmentalization need like little membrane around cell metabolism need take food eat let make things replication okay need information pass future generations lab compartmentalization seems pretty easy hard make lipid bilayers come little cellular walls pretty easily metabolism replication hard replication close people made rna like molecules lab think state art able make one molecule reproduces able make two molecules reproduce okay pretty close metabolism harder believe even though sort obvious thing want sort controlled metabolism actual cellular machinery bodies quite complicated hard see popping existence probably took making progress fact think spending nearly enough money nsf would flood area money would change view world could actually make life lab understand made originally earth sure ripple effects help cure disease mean understanding synthetic biology wonderful big frontier making cells right best way borrow heavily existing biology right well craig venter several years ago created artificial cell tremendous accomplishment take dna cell put entirely new dna let boot go leap creating intelligent life earth yeah define intelligence course let even say homo sapiens modern intelligence human brain sense involved leap big leap ai would count really want life want really organism sense ai would count think okay yeah course course ai would count well let say artificial consciousness right think threshold creating artificial consciousness think possible educated close impression really close understand little understand consciousness idea hard imagine threshold making doable possible see obstacles principle yeah would hold interest happening eventually think general consciousness think would surprised easy consciousness create intelligence think consciousness thing something fake well good actually like idea fact consciousness way less mysterious think every time every moment less conscious think right fool things think plus idea artificial intelligent systems put body right give robot body help faking lot yeah think creating consciousness artificial consciousness simple asking roomba say conscious refusing talked could could mean almost silly kind consciousness also social construct lot ideas intelligence social construct reaching bar involves something beyond necessarily involve fundamental understanding go electrons neurons cognition actually think extremely good point fact suggests yeah referred kate darling podcast experiments simple robots look like animals look like experiencing pain human beings react negatively little robots looking like experiencing pain wan na say yeah robots really pain right electrons going around realize electrons going around pain also would easy time imagining spectrum simple little robots kate works human things sort strict definition turing test level thing conscious nevertheless walk talk like conscious could future mean siri close right might future lot agents like fact rather someday going aha consciousness creep accurate reflections expect future maybe present example met basically assuming human high probability time yeah future might question marks around right yeah absolutely certainly videos almost point trust already photos ca trust right videos easier trust getting worse getting better faking right yeah physical embodied people hard faking depressing conversation right mean exciting exciting sobering thought bad right imagining next years gon na like middle phase transition right yeah general blind threats excited power technology solve protect us threats evolve much steven pinker optimistic world everything seen brilliant people world met good people army good terms development technology large okay way optimistic think goodness badness equally distributed among intelligent unintelligent people see much correlation interesting neither us proof yeah exactly opinions free right definitions good evil come without definitions without data opinions kind questions science currently answer may never able answer view well obvious one good bad right wrong think questions science tells us happens world say world part world part world ability feel like something right something wrong make long story short think idea moral philosophy systematizing intuitions right wrong science might able predict ahead time wo ever able judge whether done kind unique terms scientists listen podcasts even reaching think referred sort interdisciplinary science reach talk people outside discipline always hope science fact little disillusioned realized academia siloed yeah question level prepare conversations think conversations open mind enough conversations may little bit broader advise scientists kinds conversations podcast fact podcast awesome people get hear also good without mics general good question tough one answer think guy know personal trainer asked podcast psych workout make discipline go work like asking ca stop working need psych likewise asked get interdisciplinary conversations sorts different things sorts different people like makes go right like could stop long recorded fact lot motivation starting recording making sure would read books purchased right like books wanted read enough time read motivation cause gon na interview pat churchland gon na finally read book know absolutely true academia extraordinarily siloed right talk people rarely fact punished know like people successfully generally first became successful within little siloed discipline start expanding young person know graduate students try candid know graduate students become faculty members right tough road live life wan na live eyes open job chances broad less time spend hyper specializing field lower job chances academic reality terrible like reality people fine like plenty people wonderful scientists zero interest branching talking things anyone outside field disillusioning know romantic notion intellectual academic life belied reality idea reach beyond discipline positive good rare universities may well exist said even though saying like personal trainer ca help also inspiration others like could speak know also career thinking right without podcast may right makes realize kinds conversations kind science many ways reason write papers exchange ideas much harder interdisciplinary papers would say conversations easier conversations beginning field ai obvious think outside pure computer vision competitions particular data sets think broader impact know reaching physics psychology neuroscience conversations inspiration never know world changes mean fact stuff huge number people come grad students really loving podcast inspired probably ripple effects become faculty end balance pessimism optimism sean thank much talking awesome lex thank much conversation great\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n

machine learning although know born first technically mj michael jordan basketball anyway favorite yann lecun calling miles davis machine learning says reinvent periodically sometimes leave fans scratching heads change direction put first historian hat give history computer science ai saw experienced including four generations ai successes seen talk sure yeah first much prefer yann metaphor miles davis real explorer jazz coherent story think one one lived one think later historian look back revisit think happening right ai intellectual aspiration still alive today aspiration think akin development chemical engineering chemistry electrical engineering electromagnetism go back yet chemical engineering chemistry fluid flow mechanics people pretty clearly viewed interesting goals try build factories make chemicals products viably safely make good ones scale people started try course factories worked viable exploded parallel developed whole field called chemical engineering electrical engineering field bones theoretical aspects practical aspects engineering quote unquote real thing real concepts needed thing electrical engineering maxwell equations sense everything know electromagnetism needed figure build circuits build modules put together bring electricity one point another safely forth whole field developed called electrical engineering think happening right proto field statistics theoretical side algorithmic side computer science enough start build things things systems bring value human beings use human data mix human decisions engineering side ad hoc emerging fact wan na call machine learning field think proto form engineering based statistical computational ideas previous generations think something deeper ai dreams aspirations compared chemical engineering electrical engineering well dreams aspirations maybe years think like greeks sitting saying would neat get moon someday think clue brain computation clueless even worse greeks anything interesting scientifically era linger moment stand completely unique little bit unique clarity elaborate intuition like stand understanding human brain lot people say know scientists say far understanding human brain like saying dark well know unique even think clarity talk real neuroscientists really study real synapses real neurons agree agree hundreds year task building slowly surely signal clear think metaphors think electrical maybe chemical whole soup ions proteins cell even around like single synapse look electron micrograph single synapse city one little thing dendritic tree extremely complicated electrochemical thing spikes voltages flying around proteins taking taking dna knows problem next centuries fantastic metaphors economic device like immune system like layered set know arithmetic computations metaphors fun real science per se neuroscience neuroscience right like greek speculating get moon fun right think like say fairly strongly think lot young people think verge lot people talk clearly let understood yes kind brain inspired kind close know breakthroughs horizon scrupulous people sometimes need money labs saying scrupulous people oversell need money lab studying computational neuroscience going oversell much step gray area metaphor engineering sure familiar brain computer interfaces company like elon musk neuralink working putting electrodes brain trying able read read send electrical signals said even basic mechanism communication brain something understand hope without understanding fundamental principles brain works able something interesting gray area metaphor area hope sense like anybody else hopes interesting things happen research would expect something like alzheimer get figured modern neuroscience lot human suffering based brain disease throw things like lithium brain kind works one clue quite true mostly know even biochemistry brain leads mood swings thought emerges really really completely dim might want hook electrodes try signal processing try find patterns fine means go scientific point like kind sitting satellite watching emissions city trying infer things microeconomy even though microeconomic concepts really kind thing yes find signals something interesting useful control cursor mouse brain yeah absolutely imagine business models based even medical applications understanding algorithms allow us really tie deeply brain computer agree elon musk think even generations even century hopes getting dream mentioned kolmogorov turing might pop think might breakthroughs get sit back five years say wow oh sure think demos impress think computer call restaurant pretend human breakthrough right people know people present imitating human intelligence even putting coughs thing make bit pr stunt fine world runs things want diminish hard work engineering goes behind things like ultimate value human race scientific understanding know people work things scientific understanding meantime got kind know trains got run got mouths feed got things nothing wrong would call though engineering want distinguish engineering field like electrical engineering chemical engineering originally emerged real principles really know little scientific understanding maybe even complete became predictable really gave value human life understood want muddle much waters know able versus really ca way going impress next need wowed think someone comes along years younger person absorbed technology wowed think deeply impressed young kolmogorov would wowed stunts see right coming big companies demos think breakthroughs kolmogorov would give question chance think scientific fundamental principles arena think possible fundamental breakthroughs engineering meaning know would say things elon musk working spacex others sort trying revolutionize fundamentals engineering manufacturing saying problem know demo actually taking scale yeah going kinds breakthroughs like terminology scientist work things day day things move along eventually say wow something happened like language much also like prize theoretical breakthroughs practical ones tend theoretician think lots arena right would point kolmogorovs might point edisons era maybe musk bit like know musk god bless also say things ai knows little leads people astray talks things know anything trying program computer understand natural language involved dialogue right ai going happen lifetime could fake mimic sort take old sentences humans use retread deep understanding language going happen hope perceive deeper yet deeper kind aspects intelligence going happen breakthroughs think google breakthrough think amazon breakthrough know think uber breakthrough know bring value human beings scale new brand new ways based data flows lot things slightly broken kind engineering field takes economic value context data know planetary scale worries externalities privacy know field think things well see emerging know looking back years constituted breakthrough era like electrical engineering breakthrough early part last century chemical engineering breakthrough scale markets talk get seen sort breakthrough early days really interesting stuff get taking quick step back give kind throw historian hat mean briefly said history ai kind mimics history chemical engineering keep saying machine learning keep wanting say ai let know know resist think ai really john mccarthy almost philosopher saying would cool could put thought computer could mimic human capability think put intelligence sense computer interesting philosophical question wanted make philosophy wanted actually write logical formula algorithms would perfectly valid reasonable thing happening era reason keep saying ai actually love hear think machine learning particular set methods tools maybe version mine open optimization sampling systems learn machine learning systems learn make decisions make decisions pattern recognition know finding patterns making decisions real worlds close feedback loops something like symbolic ai expert systems reasoning systems knowledge based representation kinds things search neighbor fit think machine learning even like word machine learning think field talking making large collections decisions uncertainty large collections entities right principles scale say principles single entity making decisions single agent single human really immediately goes network decisions good word good words kind part problem continue conversation use ai want kind raise flag know intelligence real intelligence know much abstraction reasoning level humans clue trying build clue eventually may emerge make know breakthroughs eventually start get glimmers happening right okay taking data trying make good decisions based trying scale trying economically viably trying build markets trying keep value scale aspects look intelligent computers dumb seem intelligent use buzzword intelligence use sense machine learning scope narrowly learning data pattern recognition talk topics maybe data science another word could throw mix really important decisions part consequential decisions real world going medical operation going drive street things scarcity things impact human beings environments based data adaptively use computers help kinds things go forward whatever want call let call ai let agree call ai let say goal intelligence goal really good working systems planetary scale never seen reclaim word ai dartmouth conference many decades ago dream humans want reclaim want new word think bad choice mean read one little things history basically mccarthy needed new name cybernetics already existed like one really liked norbert wiener norbert wiener kind island felt encompassed sense look language cybernetics everything talking control theory signal processing notions intelligence closed feedback loops data word lived partly maybe personalities mccarthy needed new word say different part show got invented word thinking forward movies would made great choice thinking forward creating sober academic real world discipline terrible choice led promises true understand understand artificial perhaps understand intelligence small tangent one great personalities machine learning whatever heck call field think science progresses personalities fundamental principles theories research outside personalities would say one kind personality mine preferences kind network around feeds agree disagree kinds personalities needed right think personality little exuberant little bit ready promise moon little bit much ascendance think good certainly attracts lots young people field lot people come strong misconceptions unlearn find something think got multiple voices hearing enough sober voice continuation fun tangent speaking vibrant personalities would yeah think technically speaking possible help know answers less anonymity little locality know worlds kind enter trust people worlds start discussion know people going hurt going total waste time lot wasting time know lot us pulled facebook early cause clearly going waste lot time even though value yeah worlds somehow enter know getting kind appeals might new things might happen kind trust world deep interesting complex psychological aspects around anonymity changes human behavior quite dark quite dark yeah think lot us especially us really loved advent technology love social networks came see negatives started seeing comment sections think maybe know cnn something started go wow darkness know technology amplifying sorry big philosophical question topic think human beings cause also things foot psychology think human beings fundamentally good like us good intent could mind depending context environment everybody could evil answer fundamentally good fundamentally limited us know blinkers see person pain easily see person point view easily much head world good days think technology could open us know perspectives less blinkered understanding know lot wars human history happened ignorance thought person person huge amounts lifetime seen technology really help way yet believe know think fundamentally humans good people suffer people grievances grudges things cause things probably would want regret often think know part progress technology indeed allow little easier real good person actually well think individual human life society could modeled optimization problem way think typically mean talking one complex phenomenon whole know individual human life society whole mean individual human life amazingly complex know optimization kind one branch mathematics talks certain kinds things feels way limited complexity things properties optimization problems think think interesting problems could solved optimization kind properties surface non convexity convexity linearity kinds things saddle points well optimization one piece mathematics know like even era aware say sampling coming examples something coming distribution optimization sampling well kind certain kind mathematician try blend make seem sort thing optimization roughly speaking trying find point single point optimum criterion function kind sampling trying surface treat distribution density find points high density want entire distribution sampling paradigm want know single point best point optimization paradigm optimizing space probability measures output could whole probability distribution start make things mathematics go high kind abstraction hierarchy start lose know ability interesting theorems kind try try overly abstract small tangent kind worldview find appealing one deterministic stochastic well easy mean statistician know world highly stochastic know going happen next five minutes right going ask going say due uncertainty due massive uncertainty yeah know massive uncertainty best come rough sense probability distribution things somehow use reasoning distributed scale multi agent systems look like optimization optimize sort makes lot sense sort least robotics perspective single robot single agent trying optimize objective function start enter real world game theoretic concept starts popping see optimization talked markets scale look like see optimization see sampling see like mark blend together system designer thinking build incentivized system blend things know particle potential well optimizing functional called lagrangian right particle know algorithm running happens description mathematically something helps us understand analysts happening right thing happen talk know mixtures humans computers markets forth certain principles allow us understand happening whether actual algorithms used sense clear point may set multi agent market kind system thinking individual agent system asked task incentivized way get certain signals utility point wo know answer may optimize find answer okay artist could embedded inside overall market know game theory broad often studied narrowly certain kinds problems roughly speaking know going kind anticipate little bit anticipate anticipating kind go back forth minds run kind thought experiments talked interesting point terms game theory know optimization problems really hate saddle points maybe describe saddle points heard kind mentioned branch optimization could try explicitly look saddle points good thing oh optimization game theory kinds different equilibria game theory highly explanatory behavior attempting algorithmic trying say happen equilibrium would see certain kind behavior see real life economist wants especially behavioral economists continuous differential game theory continuous spaces simplest equilibria saddle points nash equilibrium saddle point special kind saddle point classically game theory trying find nash equilibria algorithmic game theory trying find algorithms would find trying find saddle points mean literally trying know economist knows nash equilibria limitations definitely explanatory many situations really want kind equilibria names associated came history certain people working new ones emerging know one example stackelberg equilibrium know nash playing game maybe cooperative going think going decide going thing simultaneously know stackelberg going first mover going make move going look move going make since know going look move anticipate going something stupid know also anticipating kind going back forth first mover thing different equilibria right mathematically yeah things certain topologies certain shapes like algorithmically dynamically move towards move away things know questions answers studied others especially becomes stochastic especially large numbers decentralized things know young people get field kind think done know tensorflow well open problems really important interesting strategic settings collect data suppose know going know well right well got collect data maybe want push part space know much get data cause later realize never never go way game set know part overall know data analysis context even game poker fascinating space whenever uncertainty lack information super exciting space linger optimization second look deep learning essentially minimization complicated loss function something insightful hopeful see kinds function surface loss functions deep learning real world trying optimize something interesting usual kind problems optimization think optimization point view surface first pretty smooth secondly parameterized kind lots paths reasonable optima kind getting downhill optimum viewed hard might expected high dimensions fact optima tend really good ones others good tend sometimes find good ones sort still needs explanation yeah particular surface coming particular generation neural nets kind suspect change years exactly surfaces others optimization theory help contribute surfaces algorithms years arithmetic operations little bit nonlinearity come neuroscience per se mean maybe minds people working thinking brains arithmetic circuits kinds fields computer science control theory layers could transform things certain ways smooth maybe could find parameter values sort big discovery working able work scale think stuck certainly stuck cause understanding brain terms algorithm side sort gradient descent think stuck gradient descent variance variance find interesting think something else invented able walk optimization spaces interesting ways co design surface architecture algorithm ask stay kind architectures neural nets know phase retrieval architectures matrix completion architectures know think kind come place yeah stochastic gradient algorithms dominant versions little better others guarantees robust ongoing research kind figure best arm situation think start co evolve put pressure actual architecture particular way different way algorithm available different way ca really anticipate co evolution process know gradients amazing mathematical objects lot people start study deeply mathematically kind shocked think way suppose tell move along x axis go uphill objective three units whereas move along axis go uphill seven units right going allow move certain unit distance right going well people say going go along axis getting biggest bang buck know buck one unit going put axis right even take strength step size put x axis getting less bang buck seems like completely clear argument wrong gradient direction go along axis take little bit x axis understand know math even trivial called operator like gradient trivial know exploiting properties still important know pervading descent got kinds problems gets stuck many ways never know good dimension dependence line work recently kinds stochasticity get dimension dependence theory come pretty favorable results certain kinds stochasticity sufficient conditions generally know give good guarantee necessary conditions must done certain way general stochasticity much randomness inject walking along gradient kind randomness randomness good process stochasticity good yeah give simple answers sense kind amazing stochasticity know particular features surface could hurt one thing deterministically wo hurt chance little chance would get hurt stochasticity kind saves particular features surfaces fact think surfaces discontinuous first derivative like absolute value function go hit point nondifferentiability running deterministic algorithm point really something bad whereas stochasticity means pretty unlikely going happen going hit point nontrivial analyze especially higher dimensions also stochasticity intuition good properties kind appealing high dimensions lot large number reasons part mathematics kind fun work field get try understand mathematics long story short know partly empirically discovered stochastic gradient effective theory kind followed say see getting clearly beautiful mysterious profound idea optimization know let say nesterov work nesterov acceleration pretty surprising pretty deep elaborate well nesterov acceleration suppose going use gradients move around space reasons alluded nice directions move suppose tell allowed use gradients going allowed use local person sense kind change surface going give kind computer able store previous gradients start learn something surface going restrict maybe move direction like linear span gradients ca kind move arbitrary direction right well defined mathematical complexity model certain classes algorithms others ca ask certain kinds surfaces fast get optimum answers smooth convex function answer one number steps squared within ball size k steps gradient descent particular slower rate one could ask gradient descent actually even though know good algorithm best algorithm answer well clear yet one k squared lower bound probably best gradient one k something better think surprise nesterov discovered new algorithm got two pieces two gradients puts together certain kind obscure way thing even move downhill time sometimes goes back uphill physicist kind makes sense building momentum kind right intuition intuition enough understand kind works achieves one k squared mathematical structure still kind day lot us writing papers trying explore understand lots cool ideas optimization kind using gradients think number one goes back know years nesterov think made major contribution idea like said gradients sense mysterious trivial trivial coordinate descent trivial one pick one coordinates think human mind thinks human minds think gradients easy human mind grapple absurd question statistics little bit somewhere math science technology somewhere convex hole set principles allow make inferences got reason believed also principles allow make decisions reason believe going make errors requires assumptions mean error mean probabilities start making assumptions led conclusions yes guarantee way probability making error small probability continuing make errors time small probability found something real small high decision making big part decision making big part yeah statistics short history goes back formal discipline years called inverse probability around era probability developed sort especially explain gambling situations course interesting would say well given state nature certain roulette board certain mechanism kind outcomes expect see especially things long amounts time outcomes see physicists started pay attention people said well let turn problem around saw certain outcomes could infer underlying mechanism inverse problem fact quite statistics called inverse probability name field believe laplace working napoleon government needed census france learn people went gathered data analyzed data determine policy said well let call field kind thing statistics word state french etat study data state anyway caught called statistics ever since time got formalized sort around time game theory decision theory developed nearby people era think either computer science statistics control econ von neumann developing game theory also thinking decision theory wald econometrician developing decision theory turning statistics data analyze loss function care question trying ask probability model risk face make certain decisions day advanced statistical curricula teach decision theory starting point branches two branches bayesian frequentist decisions statistics beautiful mysterious maybe surprising idea come across yeah good question mean bunch surprising ones something way technical thing something called james stein estimation kind surprising really takes time wrap head around try maybe think want even want try let say colleague steven stigler university chicago wrote really beautiful paper james stein estimation helps views paradox kind defeats mind attempts understand steve nice perspective one troubles statistics like physics quantum physics multiple interpretations wave particle duality physics get used time still kind haunts really quite understand relationship electron wave electron particle well thing happens bayesian ways thinking frequentist different sometimes become sort practice physically different practice give rather different answers much like wave particle duality something kind get used field define bayesian frequentist yeah decision theory make video people could see called bayesian frequentist kind help try make really clear comes decision theory know decision theory talking loss functions function data x parameter theta function two arguments okay neither one arguments known know data priori random parameters unknown right function two things know trying say want function small want small loss right well going sort say well going average quantities maximize something know turn uncertainty something certain could look first argument average could look second argument average bayesian frequentist frequentist says going look x data going take random going average distribution take expectation loss theta held fixed right called risk looking data sets could get right say well certain procedure data sets called frequentist guarantee right think appropriate like building piece software shipping people using kinds data sets want stamp guarantee people run many many data sets never even thought time right thing perfectly reasonable bayesian perspective says well going look argument loss function theta part okay unknown uncertain could personal probability know many tall people trying infer average height population idea roughly height going average theta loss function one argument gone function x bayesian say well let focus particular x got data set got condition conditional x say something loss bayesian approach things bayesian argue relevant look data sets could gotten average frequentist approach really data sets got right agree especially situations working scientist learn lot domain really focused certain kinds data gathered data make inferences agree though know sense needs frequentist guarantees writing software people using want say something two things got fight little bit blend long story short set ideas right middle called empirical bayes empirical bayes sort starts bayesian framework kind arguably philosophically know reasonable kosher write bunch math kind flows realize bunch things know real world know everything uncertain certain quantities point ask reasonable way plug estimate things okay cases quite reasonable thing plug natural thing observe world plug little bit mathematics assure really good based math based human expertise good oh going bayesian framework allows put lot human expertise math kind guides along path kind reassures end could put stamp approval certain assumptions thing work asked question favorite know surprising nice idea one accessible something called false discovery rate know making one hypothesis test making one decision making whole bag bag decisions look ones made discovery announced something interesting happened right going subset big bag ones made discovery subset bad false false discoveries like fraction false discoveries among discoveries small different criterion accuracy precision recall sensitivity specificity different quantity latter ones almost frequentist flavor say given truth null hypothesis true accuracy would get given alternative true would get kind going forward state nature data bayesian goes direction data back state nature actually false discovery rate says given made discovery okay conditioned data probability hypothesis going direction classical frequency look well ca know priors needed empirical bayesian goes ahead plows forward starts writing formulas realizes point things actually estimated reasonable way kind beautiful set ideas kind line argument come certainly mine sort came robbins around brad efron written beautifully various papers books fdr know benjamin israel john story bayesian interpretation used absorb things years find healthy way think statistics let ask intelligence jump slightly back philosophy perhaps said maybe elaborate said defining even question intelligence difficult question useful question think one day understand fundamentals human intelligence means know good benchmarks general intelligence put machines work topics much really asking question psychologist really studied consider least expert point know psychologist aims understand human intelligence right think many psychologists know fairly humble might try understand baby understands know whether something solid liquid whether something hidden maybe child starts learn meaning certain words verb noun also know slowly surely trying figure things humans ability take really complicated environment reason abstract find right abstractions communicate interact know really staggeringly rich complicated know think humility think kind aiming near future certain psychologist experiments babies lab people talking much limited aspiration know kahneman tversky would look reasoning patterns deeply understanding reasoning sort saying hey oddities reasoning things think also emphasize things writing know ai revolution happened yet yeah great blog post emphasizing know step back look intelligent systems kind whatever mean intelligence humans animals know plants whatever know market brings goods city know food restaurants something every day system decentralized set decisions looking far enough away like collection neurons every neuron making little decisions presumably way step back enough every little part economic system making decisions like brain knows individual neuron overall goal right something happens aggregate level thing economy people eat city robust works scales small villages big cities working thousands years works rain shine adaptive kind know adjectives one tends apply intelligent systems robust adaptive know need keep adjusting self healing whatever plus perfect know intelligences never perfect markets perfect believe era say well computers humans smart know markets markets intelligent humans evolve markets participating right market per se neurons could viewed market economic know neuroscience kind perspective interesting pursue point though study humans really world best psychologist studied thousands years come theory human intelligence might never discovered principles markets know supply demand curves know matching auctions real principles lead form intelligence maybe human intelligence arguably another kind intelligence probably third kinds intelligence fourth none us really thinking much right really relevant computer systems future certainly market one relevant right whereas understanding human intelligence clear relevant right probably want general intelligence whatever one means know understanding intelligence deep sense definitely human intelligence got ta broader thing mystery markets intelligent know definitely philosophical stance say got move beyond intelligence sounds ridiculous yeah blog post define different kinds like intelligent infrastructure ai really like concepts describing see see earth human civilization single organism think intelligence organism think perspective markets intelligence infrastructure increasing increasing linearly increasing exponentially think future intelligence yeah know tend think tend answer questions like know science fiction hoping catch guard well said far future fun ask probably know like said predicting future really nearly impossible say axiom one day create human level superhuman level intelligent scale markets scale individual think think would take maybe ask another question would system different biological human beings see around us today possible say anything interesting question stupid question stupid question science fiction science fiction totally happy read science fiction think time life loved like brain vat kind know little thing people talking student remember know imagine know brain body know bunch wires right suppose every one replaced literal wire suppose wire turned actually little wireless know receiver sender brain got senders receiver know exiting know axons dendrites body replaced senders receivers could move body somewhere put brain vat right could things like start killing senders receivers one one killed person know thought body walking around world moved science fiction things fun think intriguing thought think every year old take philosophy classes think things think everyone think could happen society kind bad really think right thing us age group thinking really think many present know first challenges dangers real things build know spending much time science fiction least public like think maybe beers private right well going broadcast beers going go facebook want lot people showing yeah love facebook twitter amazon youtube optimistic hopeful maybe maybe grounds optimism hope let ask mentored brightest sort seminal figures field give advice people undergraduates today take take know advice journey interested machine learning ideas markets economics psychology kinds things exploring steps take journey well yeah first door open second journey like language brilliant great brilliant ideas therefore know success enter field apprentice spend lot time work hard things try pull back broad talk lots people like entering kind creative community years needed human connections critical know think know musician artist something know immediately day one know genius therefore know practice really really hard basics humble realize never expert everything kind pick lot randomness lot kind luck luck kind picks branch tree go go branch yeah community graduate school still think one wonderful phenomena world much apprenticeship advisor much group people belong four five year process plenty time start kind nothing come something know expertise start creativity start flower even surprising self cooperative endeavor think lot people think science highly competitive think fields might way cooperative might imagine people always teaching something people always happy clear feel expert certain kinds things much expert lots things lot relevant lot know society know always willing reveal ignorance people around teach things think lot us feel way field cooperative might add also international cooperative see barriers nationalism see especially current era everything odds way us think human endeavor cooperate much trying together know benefit everybody last question learn french language beautiful english french great question first think italian actually beautiful french english also speak married italian kids speak italian anyway kidding aside every language allows express things bit differently one great fun things life explore things fact kids teens college students ask study say well heart heart certainly lot math math good everybody poetry history language know throughout life want thinking person want done french learned say late teen living middle country kansas much going kansas due respect kansas parents happened french books shelf boredom pulled found fun kind learned language reading first heard spoken idea spoken realized somehow knew previous life made connection traveled love go beyond barriers comfort whatever found trains france next say older people lived whole life ability communicate special ability also see people shoes empathy kind work language part kind experience also embedding french culture quite amazing languages rich something inherently beautiful creativity went learned lot songs read poems read books actually mit podcast today young professor yet married lot friends area kind bored person said heard lot italians around happened lot italians mit italian professor reason kind vaguely understanding talking said well learn language later met spouse italian became part life go china lot days go asia go europe every time go kind amazed richness human experience people idea traveled kind amazingly rich love diversity buzzword really means something love embed people experiences yeah learning language big part think said interview point millions dollars infinite time whatever would really work really wanted ai natural language really done right deep understanding language amazingly interesting scientific challenge one far away one far away good natural language people kind really invested think lot see core ai understand really help human communication understand something human mind semantics come human mind agree think long time career cause kind behind early days kind know enough stuff mit learn much language late point kind spend whole career

intelligence revolution happened yet calling broadening scope ai field embrace fact witnessing creation new branch engineering term engineering often invoked narrow sense academia beyond overtones cold effectless machinery negative connotations loss control humans engineering discipline want current era real opportunity conceive something historically new human centric engineering discipline resist giving emerging discipline name acronym ai continues used let aware real limitations placeholder let broaden scope tone hype recognize serious challenges ahead thank listening hope see next time say interesting disagreement jan lacune jan old friend say think disagree much really kind let build kind mentality work kind mentality kind concrete speak french speak french together lot common one wanted highlight disagreement really fundamental one think kind emphasizing jan emphasized pattern recognition emphasized prediction interesting try take far could perfect prediction would give kind thought experiment think way limited perfect prediction never data sets allow figure ready question going ask next clue never know things moreover us find day kinds situations anticipation kind novel various ways moment want think want also going market forces acting us like go street full crane street got got think got think might really want got sort think much costs action versus action got think risks involved lot current pattern recognition prediction systems risk evaluations error bars right got think people decisions around got think collection decisions even thinking like medical treatment know going take prediction neural net health something consequential ready heart attack number even data world ever collected heart attacks better doctor ever going trust output neural net predict heart attack going want ask questions around going want look us possible data causal things going want dialogue doctor things think gathered data know could go hope see think say predictions everything missing stuff prediction plus decision making everything equally important field emphasized prediction jan rightly seen powerful cost people aware decision making rubber really hits road human lives stake risks taken got gather data got think error bars got think consequences decisions others got think economy around decisions blah blah blah blah one working smaller tribe right one people talk know go real world industry know amazon say half people working decision making half know pattern recognition important words pattern recognition prediction think distinction linger words distinction constrained sort lab data set versus decision making talking consequential decisions real world messiness uncertainty real world whole whole mess actually touches human beings scale forces distinction helps add perspective broader perspective right totally agree hand real prediction person course want real world want predict real world events saying possible data sets context know strategic things someone data might gather things could gathered reasoning process around data taking data making predictions based data one things working sure others working hear often talked especially clarity talk think exciting concerning area ai terms decision making talked ai systems help make decisions scale distributed way millions billions decisions sort markets decisions starting point sort give example system think thinking kinds systems yeah first absolutely getting territory beyond expertise lots things going obvious think like like think history little bit think put back sixties kind banking system computerized really database theory emerging database people think actually move data around actual money know valid transactions atms happen actually know valid forth kind issues get start get serious sorts things like like think kind almost thought experiment help think something simpler music market first order music market world right country sure something called things called record companies make money prop really good musicians make superstars make huge amounts money long tail huge numbers people make lots lots really good music actually listened people famous people market career make money creators creators creators called influencers whatever diminishes people make extremely good music especially hip hop latin world days laptop weekend another job week put soundcloud sites eventually gets streamed gets turned bits economically valuable information lost gets put people stream walk around big city see people headphones especially young kids listening music time look data little music listening famous people music none old music latest stuff people made latest stuff like year old somewhere never make career never make money course counter examples record companies incentivize pick highlight long story short missing market consumer producer relationship level actual creative acts pipelines spotify world take stuff stream along make money subscriptions advertising things making money right offer bits pieces people highlight simulate market anyway real market would creator music actually somebody good enough people want listen data available dashboard showing map united states last week places songs listened transparent vetable someone providence sees listened times providence know real data know real data come give show broadcast people listening coming right could go make three times year start career sense ai creates jobs taking away human jobs creating new jobs creates new market created market connected producers consumers person making music say someone comes shows lot hey play daughter wedding say say get income going millionaire even think really value music personal connections even much young kid wants wear tshirt favorite musician signature listen music internet internet able provide button push merchandise arrives next day well kid bought shirt happy person made music get money advertising needed create markets producers consumers take cut company perfectly sound go forward future create new markets raises human happiness seems like well easy create dashboard kind create connections think uber whatever think challenges real world things like actually new principles going needed trying create new kind two way market different scale ever done going unwanted aspects market bad people data get used wrong ways fail ways wo deliver think like anyone ran big auction ran big matching service economics think things maybe get huge issues arise start create markets starts least solidify thoughts allow move forward thinking yeah talked head research spotify actually think longterm goal said least one million creators make comfortable living putting spotify think articulate really nice vision world digital cyberspace markets think companies like spotify youtube netflix create markets ai problem interface problem interface design kind economics problem hire solve problems well part top silicon valley attitude know create system like google search box good everyone adopt everything said really think missing kind culture literally year old able create songs create silicon valley entity hire per se create ecosystem wanted belong cultural credibility things like netflix credit wanted credibility created shows content call content terrible word culture movies kind go give large sum money somebody graduating usc film school whole thing kind like rich white people thing american culture much rich white people immigrants africans came brought culture rhythms world created whole new thing american culture companies ca artificially create ca say hey going buy got partner anyway denigrate companies trying sure asking questions even making effort partly respect culture technology person got blend technology cultural meaning much role think algorithm machine learning connecting consumer creator sort recommender system aspect yeah great question think pretty high magic algorithms good recommender system way better bad recommender system recommender systems billion dollar industry back even years ago continues extremely important going forward favorite recommender system put something well historically one first went amazon first like amazon put book people business library local booksellers went business come accept probably books sold poor people reading ever local book stores coming back economics sometimes work go go anyway finally started going bought books really pleased see another books recommended never would thought bought bunch obviously good business model learned things still day kind browse using service think lots people get lot good aspect recommendation system learning peers indirect way algorithms meant impose learn really trying find data work well kinds entities complexity human life like shirts going get recommendations shirts interesting try recommend restaurants hard hard scale blend recommendation systems economic ideas matchings really really still open research wise new companies going emerge well think going messy difficult land say politics things like youtube twitter deal terms recommendation systems able suggest think facebook launched facebook news recommend kind news likely interesting think ai solvable whatever term want use think solvable problem machines deeply human problem unsolvable even think level think broken companies monetization advertising least facebook want critique really try connect producer consumer economic way right one wants pay anything know starting google facebook went back playbook know television companies back day one wanted pay signal pay tv box signal least back day advertising kind filled gap advertising new interesting somehow take lives quite right fast forward google provides service people want pay somewhat surprisingly nineties made ended making huge amounts cornered advertising market seem like going happen least little things right hand side screen seem economically interesting companies maybe choice tv market going away billboards got think sadly google well making money think much wait minute producer consumer relationship set us advertisers market created actual market producer consumer producers person created video clip person made website person could make things person could adjust function demand person side asking different kinds things know see glimmers influencers kind little glimmering market done years ago thought created parallel advertising ecosystem facebook inherited think also think much fast forward making huge amounts money advertising news thing clicks feeding advertising connected advertiser want people click certain things money flows facebook much incentivized start find breaking people telling well getting troubles try adjust smart ai algorithms right figure bad clicks maybe click rate something else find pretty much hopeless get complexity human life try fix could also fix whole business model business model really human producers consumers economic value liberated connecting directly valuable people able pay right micro payments like small payments micro even micro like example suppose going next week going india never india right couple days mumbai idea right could go web right search going kind hopeless going find know lots advertisers face right really want broadcast world going mumbai someone side market look recommendation system looking possible people coming mumbai looking people relevant someone age group someone kind knows level give little privacy happy going get back person make little video going write little two page paper cool things want move week especially right going look going pay micro payment going pay know hundred dollars whatever real value like journalism um honest subscription going pay person moment company going take person got gig economy know done know thinking little bit behind youtube actually people could make things connected market would make things independently tell incentivize way um yeah companies think thought long hard distinguish facebook one side thought things think uh thinking ai fix everything uh amazon thinks time already real world delivering packages people doors worried market worried sellers know worry things great things maybe great know business model say google sort hovers somewhere think long long time got think probably see youtube pregnant possibility might thought probably heading direction um uh know silicon valley dominated google facebook kind mentality subscription advertising core problem right fake news actually rides top means monetizing clip rate core problem got remove advertisement going linger mean interesting thesis know everyone really deeply thinks right thought advertising model thing thing ever fix build algorithms despite business model know find better angels nature good society individual think slowly think first difference could saying slowly move away advertising model direct connection consumer creator question also advertising model successful terms making huge amount money therefore able build big company provides really smart people working create good service think possible clarify think move away well think yeah know society yeah well companies mean first full disclosure day week amazon kind want learn things know speaking amazon way know go actually believe get little bit trying create markets really use advertising crucial part well good question become crucial become present go amazon website know without revealing many deep secrets amazon tell know lot people company question huge questioning going want world zero advertising actually bad world okay way think company like amazon trying bring products customers right customer given moment want buy vacuum cleaner say want know available know going obvious little bit work recommendation system sort help right suppose person made world know spent huge amount energy great idea made great vacuum cleaner know really nailed mit know whiz kid made great new vacuum cleaner right going recommendation system one know algorithms find ai fix okay right allow vacuum cleaner start get front people sold well advertising advertising signal believe product enough willing pay real money consumer look signal say well first know cheap little ads cause right know know super cheap know pennies see ad actually know company making know real money kind flowing see ad may pay attention actually might want see hey guy spent money vacuum cleaner maybe something good look part overall information flow good market advertising role problem course signal completely gone know dominant tiny little things add big money company know think think change societies know stick things annoy lot people advertising currently annoys people provides information think google probably smart enough figure dead bad model even though hard huge amount money figure pull away slowly sure ceo figure need needed reduce advertising zero reduce time bring producer consumer actual real value delivered real money paid take cut could start get big enough cancel lost revenue kind poor kind advertising think good company realize facebook know god bless bring know grandmothers bring children pictures grandmothers lives fantastic need think new business model core problem start connect producer consumer think continue make money buy next social network company buy next one innovation level high health issues go away apologize kind returned words think exact terms matter sort defense advertisement think kind direct connection consumer creator producer advertisement strives right best advertisement literally facebook listening conversation heard going india able actually start automatically making connections start giving offer like apologize matter terms draw distinction possible make advertisements better better better algorithmically actually becomes connection almost direct connection good question let component first talked defending advertising okay defending way get signals market come way especially algorithmically sign someone spent money sign think valuable think things someone else thinks valuable trust people might willing listen trust facebook though intermediary think care okay think find creepy know going india next week conversation think could put pr hat think find facebook creepy trust majority population silicon valley companies saw like approval rate ranking much people trust companies facebook gutter gutter including people inside facebook attribute come find creepy right talking might walk street right unknown person know kind comes says hear going india mean even facebook want transparency human society want know something actually reason know something something look later audit kind approve know something care way caring relationship even economic one something someone could exploit ways know care troubled whatever world right happens way much facebook knows things lot people could exploit exploit times think people find creepy facebook care real sense big brother caring us role company like wait big brother part caring trusting mean companies link lot companies lot information us would argue companies like microsoft information us facebook yet trust microsoft well microsoft pivoting microsoft know satya nadella decided really important want creepy things really want people trust us actually use information ways really would approve decide right kind adding health market connect someone produces consumer random producer consumer people see like sense transact happiness go sides company helps moments choose choosing fine also think difference know browsing versus buying right moments life want buy know gadget something need something moment need ammonia house something got problem spill want go want advertised moment want led various know annoying want go extremely easy want moments might say like today going shopping mall want walk around see things see people exposed stuff want control though want company algorithms decide right think thing total loss control facebook thinks take control us deciding want certain kinds information information much relates know us really want know us want helping way want helping decide control want totally agree facebook way optimistic thing think facebook kind personal information us could create beautiful thing really optimistic facebook could could see think optimism misplaced bit business model behind things create beautiful thing really let let clear something people would value think business model think suddenly discover know long hot shower disagree disagree terms discover lot amazing things shower say said wo come wo shower think lot people discover think guy also full disclosure company called united masters board created music market hundred thousand artists signed done things like gone nba nba music find behind nba clips right music right company right business model mind get go right executed day one value brought kid made songs suddenly songs nba website right real economic value people know differ optimism able sort change direction titanic right yeah older seen titanic crash got elaborate cause totally agree want know difficult think problem example want read news would lot times day something makes either smile think way like consciously think really gave value like sometimes listen daily podcasts new york times way better new york times way people listening like real journalism happening reason podcast space make sense often listen minutes would willing pay like experience difficult kind getting little transaction difficult create frictionless system like uber example things intuition first pay little bits money know send something called courts financial things like medium site pay would great post medium would loved pay dollar others would wanted per se also sites actually goal goal actually broadcast channel monetize way chose mean could people know could fine also musicians making music think right model pay little subscription fee right people copy bits easily somewhere value value connection made real human beings follow right create yet value think lot open questions hot open questions also yeah want good recommendation systems recommend cool stuff pretty hard right like recommend stuff based browsing history like based stuff know quote unquote unknown interesting really interesting question may disagree maybe think love recommender systems want give everything way trust yeah example morning clicked know pretty sleepy morning clicked story queen england yes right give damn queen england really clickbait kind looked funny say heck talking want life know heading direction browsing history system reasonable system think care queen england browsing history right saying trace digital exhaust whatever kind models collect stuff going figure us well trying figure like kind one person like trump something maybe could figure trying figure know million people know way way think think think humans amazingly rich complicated every one us little quirks every one us little things could intrigue us even know intrigue us sign past god comes know fall love want company trying figure anticipate want provide forum market place kind go hook crook happens know walking street hear chilean music played never knew liked chilean music wow side want provide limited know interesting place go right try use ai kind know figure put world figured know create huge spaces human beings creativity style enriched come forward lot transparency wo people randomly anonymously putting comments special based stuff know facts know broken right know especially celebrity know anybody anonymous people hurting lots lots people right part thing silicon valley thinking know collect information use great way pessimist much optimist nature think wrong path whole technology take limited create let humans rise try replace ai mantra try anticipate try predict going going able things going make things worse okay right give chance right recommender systems creepy people shadow watching every move looking traces directly interacting sort close friends family way know conversation actually interactions back forth think place recommender systems sort step cause emphasize value human human connection yeah give chance ai human connection role ai system conversations terms try figure kind music like watching listening actually conversation natural language otherwise yeah wanted push back maybe saying options facebook think misplaced think distributing yeah good go hard spot yeah good human interaction like daily context around home something want big company know would happy technology help kind technology well know alexa amazon well good alexa done right think alexa research platform right anything else alexa done right know could things like leave water running garden say hey alexa water running garden even alexa figure means wife comes home told little bit reasoning would call ai kind stretch little bit reasoning actually kind would make life little easier better know would call wow moment kind think overall rises human happiness kind thing lonely alexa knowing loneliness want alexa feel intrusive want designer system kind work really want lot control want transparency control company stand give context new technology think good first way successful current generation like said mentioning microsoft really think pivoting kind trusted old uncle know think get way go let people find technology empowers control control privacy rich set interactions people going like lot right business model going forward control privacy look like think able view data much mean first individual decision people want privacy want whole life people want privacy zero one legal thing data available like recall people know couple hundred years ago everyone really big cities everyone lived countryside villages villages everybody knew everything privacy bad better well know arguably get loss certain kinds privacy well people help know everything know something bad happening help right live big city one knows get help kind depends answer want certain people trust relationships kind manage knows agency drift sea technology agency want go reading things checking boxes know privacy researcher per se recognize vast complexity technology legal scholars meeting technologists got ta kind whole layers around alluded emerging engineering field big part electrical engineering came one around time plug electricity walls kinds work like underwriters laboratory reassured plug going burn house machine everything whole people install things people watch installers whole layers know onion kinds things things deep interesting privacy least interesting electricity going take decades kind work going require lot new structures right kind hard talk saying lot money made get right something look lot money made things provide human services people recognize useful parts lives yeah yeah dialogue sometimes goes exuberant technologists technology good kind know public discourse know far see much kind thing sober discussions middle challenge wants need conversations know actually many forum fora know kind would look maybe could go could read comment section something would actually kind dialogue going back forth see much right actually resurgence podcasts people really hungry conversation technology helping much comment sections anything including youtube hurting helping\",\n          \"becoming cyborgs brains fundamentally changed everyone grew electronics fundamentally different previous homo sapiens call us homo techno think evolved homo techno like essentially new species previous technologies mean may even profound moved us certain degree think computers make us homo techno think brain augmentation like allows actual evolution like computers accelerate degree technologies also accelerated would classify homo sapien homo techno definitely homo techno one earliest species think us following conversation grimes artist musician songwriter producer director fascinating human thinks lot history future human civilization studying dark periods past help form optimistic vision future lex friedman podcast support please check sponsors description dear friends grimes oh yeah cloud lifter go go know stuff ever used cloud lifter yeah actually microphone cloud lifter michael jackson used really yeah like thriller stuff mic cloud lifter yeah incredible microphone flattering vocals used lot great demo vocals great room sometimes easier record vocals room music playing wan na feel headphones mic pretty directional think good mic vibing getting real good vocal take vibing room anyway michael jackson quincy jones microphone feel way badass right wan na get guess right one names least space time c like letter told c means lot things speed light render rate universe yes spanish crescent moon happens favorite programming language basically runs world also powerful fast dangerous mess things really bad pointers anyway associations name c coolest mean coolest speed light obviously speed light say render rate universe think mean speed light essentially rendering see think know simulation speed light changes improve render speed well already pretty good already pretty good improves know probably like okay updated upgraded well fast enough us humans seems immediate delay latency terms us humans earth interacting things like intergalactic species operating much larger scale gon na start noticing weird stuff operate like around black hole gon na start see render issues ca go faster speed light correct really limits ability one ability travel space theoretically wormholes nothing general relativity precludes faster speed light travel seems gon na really funky stuff heavy things like weirdnesses basically terrors space time know navigators know navigators yeah folding space basically making wormholes name yes think multiple people one person know like morning different person tonight say recording basically midnight awesome yes thank much think eight hours late right time good morning beginning new day soon anyway person morning evening multiple people think one person maybe clue giant mystery okay really intense questions let go let go asked like look mirror people tell even mean mean think personality changes everyone talk inconsistent personality yeah person person interaction personality materializes mood like go like megalomaniac like know like total hermit shy combinatorial combination mood person interacting yeah mood people interacting think everyone like maybe well everybody acknowledges able introspect brings kind person kind mood brings best artist human introspect like best friends like people like super confident know gon na understand everything saying like best friends start really funny always like peak mode like yeah takes lot get let talk constraints talked constraints limits help artist human get way like constraints creating music creating art living life like constraints world puts hate constraints moving good right like like progressing technology changing constraints like artistic creation know making video music stuff getting lot cheaper constantly new technology new software making faster easier much freedom like michael jackson know recorded thriller microphone like use mixing desk stuff like probably even get studio probably really expensive really good singer know use like mixing desk everything know make made whole album computer lot freedom also constrained different ways like literally millions artists like much bigger playing field like also learn music natural musician know anything actual music know like computer really kind like messing around like trying things well yeah mean nature music changing saying know actual music music changing music becoming talked becoming like merging technology yes becoming something like notes piano becoming weird composition requires engineering skills programming skills kind human robot interaction skills still things michael jackson like good ear good sense taste good final thing put together like allowed enabled empowered laptop layer stuff start like layering insane amounts stuff super easy think music production really underrated art form feel like people really appreciate look publishing splits way people like pay producers stuff super producers deeply underrated like many songs popular right last years like part reason popular production really interesting really sick really cool like think listeners like people really understand music production sort like weird discombobulated art form like formal new like formal training path mostly driven like autodidacts like like almost everyone know good production like go music school anything taught mostly different like music producers know commonalities time together different kinds weirdos cause hung rick rubin know yeah mean rick rubin like literally one gods music production like one people first know like made music production know made production important actual lyrics notes thing interesting know speak hanging seems sit silence close eyes listen like almost nothing nothing somehow gives freedom best version music production somehow like encouraging less simplify like push towards minimalism mean guess mean work differently rick rubin cause rick rubin produces artists whereas like mostly produce different situation also think rick rubin would say advanced category producer like like earned engineer stuff people like stuff usually like stuff engineer producer artist yeah guess would say era like post rick rubin era like come kind like skrillex school thought like yeah engineer producer artist like mean lately sometimes work producer gently sort delicately starting collaborate bit like think kind like whatever explosion things everything became available computer kind got like lone wizard energy thing going embraced loneliness loneliness somehow engine creativity like stuff creative quote unquote genius quotes privacy mind yes well thing talking daniel eck said like artists years like good years usually stop making like vital shit feel like sort like nearing end years become somebody else like process becoming somebody else reinventing work people never worked people find make like exceptionally rejuvenated making like vital work ever made think another human brain like one best tools possibly find like funny way put love like tool like know whatever hp plus one like adds like stats character like another human brain like square instead like adding something double experience points love also mention playing tavern music love first think first stop tavern music yeah audio okay okay makes yeah make podcast annoying add post add post one want listen podcast probably would makes reminds like video game like role playing video game experience points something really joyful wandering places like elder scrolls like skyrim exploring landscapes another world get experience points work different skills somehow progress life know simple messy complexities life usually bad guy fight skyrim dragons sure elden ring bunch monsters fight love feel like elden ring feel like good analogy music production though like feel like engineers people creating open worlds sort like similar people music producers like hidden archetype like one really understands one really knows like like artist engineer like art fairly complex engineering well saying get enough credit kind changing becoming person everything engineer well mean others gone know like timbaland skrillex people like know famous think general think people get confused really know per se see song like like hit song like trying think like going like even basic pop hit like like rules dua lipa something production actually like really crazy mean song also great like production exceptionally memorable like know like one ca even know produced song like part like rhetoric discuss creation art sort like consider music producer think music producer used simply recording things yeah interesting think movies talk actor actresses also talk directors talk like music often beatles music producer one first kind guy one first people sort introducing crazy sound design pop music forget name forget name know like weird stuff like dropping pianos like yeah oh get yeah yeah yeah get sound get authentic sound lyrics think fit important heartbroken learn elvis write songs mad lot people write songs understand thing feel like desire authenticity used like really mad like people would write produce music like fake realized like weird bitterness like agronus art authenticity kind like weird realization recently started thinking like art sort decentralized collective thing like art kind conversation artists ever lived know like like really sort like anyone reinventing wheel like kind taking know thousands years art like running little algorithm like making interpretation joined conversation artists came beautiful way look like like feel like everyone always like copyright ip authenticity like think need stop seeing like egotistical thing like oh creative genius lone creative genius like think art think art something sort brings humanity together also art also kind collective memory humans like give fuck whatever ancient egypt like much grain got sent day sending records like know like went know many shields needed produced like remember art like know like day day life stuff seems important art helps us function survive gone like thing really gon na left art technology obsolete fascinating like humans dead true good compression human history art generated across different centuries different millennia aliens come aliens come gon na find hieroglyphics pyramids mean art could broadly defined might find like engineering marvels bridges rockets guess sort classify though architecture art consider engineering formats art sure sucks like digital art easier delete apocalypse nuclear war disappear yes physical something still valuable physical manifestation art sucks like music example played somebody yeah think foundation type situation like know like seed banks north stuff like probably like solar powered geothermal little bunker like human knowledge mentioned daniel ek spotify think artist spotify empowering spotify consumer super exciting makes easy access music kinds artists get explore kinds music make super easy sort curate playlist fun liberating let go know used collect know albums cds like horde albums yeah like matter reality could know really liberating could let go letting go albums kind collecting allows find new music exploring new artists kind stuff know perspective artist could like mentioned competition could kind constraint artists platform think better artists mean might propaganda conversation daniel ek could easily propaganda victim somebody propaganda let accept daniel ek telling know understand really difficult concepts different way like emotional intelligence something deep within oh yeah like x hurts like x bites really hard like ow like gets sad like sad hurts accident yeah huge hurts lot accident yeah interesting mind emerges children really memory time ca even conversation yeah thank god memory time like think like mean youngest baby like like like read sci fi short story mouth must scream good title oh man mean read mouth must scream hate getting

mean like joke know love idea holy rain empire yeah like kafkaesque pro bureaucracy cult feel like human civilization said like oh kind humanity bureaucracy cult yeah theory really think really bureaucracy starting kill us think like need reorient laws stuff like think need sunset clauses everything like think rate change culture happening fast rate change technology everything happening fast like see hearings like social media cambridge analytica everyone talking like even point much technological change happened like hearings like trying make laws ai stuff feel like updating things like every five years like one big issues society right getting bogged laws making hard change things develop things austin wan na speak much like one friends working housing bill austin try like prevent like san francisco situation happening obviously getting little mini san francisco like housing prices skyrocketing causing massive gentrification really bad anyone super rich like much bureaucracy part reason happening need permits build takes like years get permits like build anything hard build limited housing massive influx people like know microcosm like problems happening world like dealing laws like years old longer relevant slowing everything causing massive social pain yeah like also makes sad see politicians talk technology really get importantly lack curiosity like like inspired excitement like stuff works stuff like see cynical view technology like tech companies trying evil world perspective curiosity like recommender systems work ai systems work natural language processing robotics works computer vision works know always take cynical possible interpretation technology would used definitely concerned constantly worried regulating based going slow innovation think huge priority right undoing bad energy surrounding emergence silicon valley like think like lot things irresponsible time know like even current whole thing twitter everything like lot negative outcomes sort technocracy boom one things happening like alienating people wanting care technology actually think technology probably better probably best think fix lot problems easily technology know fighting powers know go back star wars quote buckminster fuller quote let go dark questions may time darkest place ever gone mind time period time moment remember difficult mean best friend died

like really weird middle ground like finding happy medium wisdom fresh ideas fighting like like really like need like fresh ideas wisdom like collaborating like fighting way searching happy medium way maybe finding happy medium maybe happy medium looks like ai systems know reinforcement learning dance exploration exploitation sort crazy stuff see something better think optimal optimal thing dancing back forth would stuart russell know know ai guy thinks sort control super intelligent ai systems idea inject uncertainty sort humility ai systems never get wiser wiser wiser intelligent never really sure always doubt sense think young people mechanism doubt like society doubts whether thing converged towards right answer voices young people society asking question way stuff past years maybe wrong way within one ai system also think though need mean actually actually really interesting really cool also think fine balance think maybe also overvalue idea old systems always bad think things perfecting might accidentally overthrowing things actually gotten good point value disruption much value fighting generations us much also aspect sometimes taking two steps forward one step back okay maybe kind solve thing like fucking know think like middle ground yeah search happy medium let ask bunch crazy questions okay right answer short way long way scariest thing ever done questions gon na ridiculous something tiny something big something big skydiving touring first record going podcast two crazy brushes like really scary brushes death randomly got away scay know talk well know think

things burdens useful burden useful burden yeah sure wan na understand evil psychopathy fake twitter accounts go different algorithmic bubbles try understand keep getting fights people realize actually fighting think used exist monoculture social media stuff kinda got fed thing speaking cultural language think recently one things diagnosing properly enough social media different dialects many different dialects chinese becoming different dialects english realizing people saying exact things using completely different verbiage punishing using correct verbiage completely misunderstanding people misunderstanding people saying got fight friend anarchism communism shit two hours end conversation say something like literally saying like like fuck different like english way understanding terminology like drastically like algorithm bubbles creating mini dialects language interpreted language used fascinating like arguments need polarization happening need happening got like algorithmically created dialects occurring plus top also different parts world speak different languages literally lost translation kind communication happen know russian language know different english language wonder much lost little bit man actually cause question song coming tomorrow speak russian band speak little bit russian looking title title english match title russian curious cause look says title english last day title russian new day pronunciation sucks new day like like new day new day yeah new day new day like two different meanings yeah new day yeah yeah yeah new day new day last day new day last day would last day yeah maybe maybe title includes russian maybe maybe bilingual honest novodin sounds better musically like novodin new day current one posledniy den last day think novodin like novodin meaning different kind awesome actually though explicit sort contrast like everyone earth disappeared left would day look like like would everybody dead far corpses well seriously big let think big difference like birds singing versus like corpses littering street yeah corpses everywhere sorry actually know happened know survived even know others seems clear gone would would listen somebody really enjoys moment enjoys life would go like enjoying inanimate objects would look food basic survival listen take walks look outside happy get exist planet able breathe air beautiful full colors kind stuff many things life life conscious life fucking awesome would enjoy also maybe weeks engineer would start coming like wan na build things maybe always hope searching another human maybe probably searching another human probably trying get tv radio station broadcast something interesting think like really maximize ability connect others yeah like probably try find another person would excited see meet another person terrified know excited matter yeah yeah yeah yeah alone last however long life would really bad one instance might think kill might kill love people love connection humans yeah kinda hate people yeah love hate relationship yeah feel like bunch weird nietzsche questions stuff though oh yeah like wonder cause like podcast like interesting people like know maybe people like listen podcasts like lore like hard lore like love like dan carlin like give facts like like facts bloodstream also know like fascinating mind explore realize talking stuff stuff taken granted actually unique fascinating way think always like way reason things fascinating thing listen people kind see oh humans think differently explore thoughts differently cool also cool yeah dan carlin retelling history way retelling history think exciting history way thinking history think dan carlin one people like dan carlin one people really started getting excited like revolutionizing education like dan carlin instilled already like really liked history instilled like obsessive love history point like fucking reading like going bed reading like part four rise fall third reich whatever like got like dense ass history like like opened door like made want scholar topic like like feel like good teacher like know sort made feel like one things could education like find like world great teachers like create passion topic autodidactricism know say properly like self teaching like much faster lectured like much efficient sort like able teach ask teacher questions know like know like university stuff like learn much material much faster lot learning going teachers get stuck like teachers inspire passion topic think one invaluable skills whole species like like ai like ai going teach much efficiently teach needed get point teach finds motivation right yeah like inspire yeah could teach make fact mentioned rise fall third reich read yeah read twice read twice yes okay one even knows yeah like wait thought like super poppin book super pop yeah like far interesting yeah written person important kind know start like could possibly happen read rise fall third reich like people tried really hard happen people tried almost reinstated monarchy one point try stop happening like almost like abandoned democracy try get happen least way makes feel bunch small moments history turn yes like small meetings yes human interactions terrifying inspiring like even attempts assassinating hitler like time time failed close like operation valkyrie good also role really heavy burden geopolitical perspective role leaders see evil truly becomes evil anticipate stand evil evil actually pretty rare world scale hitler tend know modern discourse kind call people evil quickly look ancient history like ton hitlers actually think norm like going back like sort intelligent design theory think one things successfully slow move survival fittest intelligent design kind eradicating like look like ancient assyria stuff like shit like brutal like heads like brutal like genghis khan like genocide genocide like throwing plague bodies walls decimating whole cities like muslim conquests like damascus shit like people cities used get leveled fucking time okay get bronze age collapse basically like almost like roman level like society like like world like global trade like everything awesome mix think bit climate change development iron basically bronze could come way make bronze like everything funneled one iranian mine like one supply chain one things makes worried supply chains think need thoughtful think biggest issue society right like thing likely go wrong probably supply chain collapse war climate change whatever like anything causes supply chain collapse population big handle like thing seems cause dark ages mass supply chain collapse bronze age collapse happened like sort like ancient collapse happened like literally like ancient egypt cities everything got like decimated destroyed abandoned cities like hundreds like flourishing society like almost coming modernity everything got leveled mini dark ages like little writing recording time like lot information bronze age collapse basically equivalent like medieval medieval dark ages happened know years like thousands years earlier sort like recovered bronze age collapse empire reemerged writing trade everything reemerged course contemporary dark ages time designed mechanism lessen lessen capability destructive power centers emerge recording contemporary dark ages think like better understanding avoid still think high risk think one big risks right natural state humans lot hitlers gotten really good making hard emerge gotten better collaboration resisting power like authoritarians come power trying go country country like moving past kind like slowly incrementally like moving towards like scary old school war stuff think seeing happen countries least nominally like supposed moved past scary reminds us happen like places moved supposedly hopefully moved past possibly civilization level like said supply chain collapse might make people resource constraint might make people desperate angry hateful violent drag us right back mean supply chain collapse like ultimate thing caused middle ages supply chain collapse like people people reliant certain level technology like people like look like britain like glass like people aqueducts people like indoor heating cooling like running water like buy food world trade markets like people know hunt forage gather similar situation educated enough survive without technology supply chain collapse like limits access technology like massive starvation violence displacement war like know like yeah opinion like primary marker like dark age well technology kind enabling us resilient terms supply chain terms different catastrophic events happened us although pandemic kind challenged preparedness catastrophic think coolest invention humans come wheel fire cooking meat computers computers freaking computers internet computers one think previous technologies mean may even profound moved us certain degree think computers make us homo tech think brain augmentation like allows actual evolution like computers accelerate degree technologies also accelerated would classify homo sapien homo techno definitely homo techno one earliest species think us like said like think like looked brain scans us versus humans hundred years ago would look different think physiologically different even interaction devices changed brains well look lot studies coming show like degree inherited memory physiological changes theory passing like know like instance physiological change gon na fizzle theory progress like offspring speaking offspring advice would give young person like high school whether artist creative engineer kind career path maybe life general live life proud think one big thoughts like especially kids think spend enough time teaching creativity think creativity muscle like things lot emphasis know learn play piano write song like learn technical stuff thing think like friend like world greatest guitar player like know amazing sort like producer works people really sort like know like engineers records things like solos really like make music talking like dude talented music like make music whatever like cause got old never learned creative muscle like know embarrassing like learning creative muscle takes lot failure also sort creative know throwing paint wall lot stuff fail like part like tolerance failure humiliation somehow easier develop young persist young everything easier develop young yes younger better could destroy mean shitty thing creativity know failure could destroy careful risk worth taking also young age developing tolerance failure good fail time like stupid shit time like public private get canceled make kinds mistakes like resilient making mistakes like lot things like people would like think greatest asset creativity like think pain like tolerance failure super essential thing taught things brilliant advice yeah yeah wish everybody encouraged sort failure opposed kind cause like punish failure like like teaching kids like wrong like know like x keeps like like wrong know met came furious spotify like grilled super hard got answers saying like sort peak cd industry like artists making millions millions dollars like like tiny kind spotify kind democratized industry think said million artists making good living spotify heard like honestly would rather make less money like decent living artists able even though like wish could include everyone yeah really hard argue youtube youtube mission want basically many creators possible make living kind living hard argue hard think better ways manager actually wish like would brought manager building app manage like help organize percentages get publishing dah dah dah dah dah take middlemen much bigger like automate get automate manager automate management publishing legal read app building read contract like tell one issues music right getting paid enough art industry filled middlemen artists good business beginning like frank sinatra mob stuff like music industry run business people artists artists really get small cuts like make think part reason technocrat mean fans gon na technocrats one gon na mad like fans hate say kind thing general public like technocrats like technocrats like watched battle angel alita like martian technocracy like yeah martian technocracy like evil like oh okay like cause martian technocracy sounds sick yeah intuition technocrats would create kind beautiful world example manager working create app removes need lawyer could smart contracts blockchain removes need like management organizing stuff like read stuff explain collect royalties know like small amounts amount money getting spotify actually means lot goes lot farther remove bureaucracy inefficiencies make life great could yeah think issue enough like issue inefficiency really positive sum mindset know win win mindset like instead know fighting scraps make worrying scarcity like instead scarcity mindset increase efficiency know way expand size pie let ask experimentation said beautiful musician like conversation came much creating music like kind conversation trying fit cultural trends much like trying much possible outsider come something totally new like thinking experimenting trying totally different totally weird trying fit man hard feel like kind process semi retiring music like old brain yeah bring like shelf put table couple minutes poke think bit think forcing engage new music really great neuroplasticity like think know people part reason music marketed young people young people neuroplastic like like whatever gon na really easy love new music older gets harder harder harder think one beautiful things musician constantly force listen new music think keeps brain really plastic think really good exercise think everyone listen new music hate think keep force like okay well people like like know make brain form new neural pathways open change really brilliant actually sorry interrupt like exercise really amazing sort embrace change embrace sort practice neuroplasticity like one things fall love certain band kind stay rest life never understand modern music really good exercise streaming spotify like classic rock stuff like new music makes small chunk played spotify think like good sign us species think yeah good measure species open mindedness change often listen new music brain let put music brain back shelf got ta pull futurist brain second wild ways think future say like years maybe years maybe hundred years different current way life earth talk augmented reality virtual reality maybe robots maybe space travel maybe video games maybe genetic engineering keep going cyborgs aliens world wars maybe destructive nuclear wars good bad think future imagining weirdest wildest could read surface detail iain banks surface detail favorite depiction oh wow read book literally greatest science fiction book possibly ever written iain banks man yeah sure read player games read titles ca copyrighted steal like player games sick nice yeah name album like always wanted romeo juliet something always wanted name album war peace nice like would like good good heard like could also things public domain people clue song called player games yes oh yeah iain banks surface detail opinion best future ever read heard science fiction basically relationship super intelligence like artificial super intelligence like great want credit person coined term love term feel like young women get enough credit yeah go protopia futures instagram name personalized donor experience scale ai power donor experience monica bealskite saying wrong probably gon na probably butchering bit protopia sort utopia unattainable protopia sort like know wow awesome instagram protopia futures great future know good get future positive future ai centralized ai surface detail distributed kind ai mostly exist giant super ships like sort like guild ships dune like giant ships kind move people around ships sentient talk passengers mean lot different types ai banksyan future opening scene surface detail place called culture culture basically protopian future protopian future think like future like obviously utopia perfect like cause like striving utopia think feels hopeless sort like maybe best terminology using like pretty good place like mostly like know super intelligence biological beings exist fairly harmony much war like close equality get know like approximately good future like really awesome stuff opening scene girl born sex slave outside culture society adhere cultural values tries kill guy like master kills unbeknownst traveling ship culture like say like crazy things like x keeps like like bubble car bubble car like know like bubble car like like like want like wrong like thinking weird crazy shit like know bubble car like creating worlds might internally consistent might discover something fundamental world yeah like rewrite songs like words prefers like instead baby shark says baby car like maybe onto something let ask big ridiculous question kind dancing around think meaning whole thing human civilization life earth general life meaning life read nova scene yet james lovelock lot really good book recommendations even finished huge fraud yet like really early book says amazing thing like feel like everyone sad cynical like everyone like fermi paradox everyone keep hearing people like fuck alone like oh ah like ah ah like okay like wait beginning like nova scene says gon na correct ca like memorize quotes says something like consciousness like right like universe waking like instead discovering universe universe like evolution literal universe like separate universe like universe waking universe seeing first time like universe becoming conscious first time part yeah cause like separate universe like could like incredibly sacred moment maybe like social media things stuff getting connected together like maybe neurons connecting like collective super intelligence waking yeah like know like maybe instead something cynical maybe something discover like maybe know blast assist like incredible kind consciousness like first three years life human children forget suffering going think probably forget mean probably know artificial intelligence eventually render us obsolete think malicious way think probably weak sun expanding like know like hopefully get mars like pretty vulnerable know like think coexist long time ai also probably make less vulnerable know think consciousness sentience self awareness like think might single greatest like moment evolution ever like maybe know big like true beginning life blue green algae like single celled organisms something amazing universe awakens yeah well see incredible person fascinating mind definitely friend liv mentioned guys thinking maybe talking would love explored mind kind media podcast kind way awesome person honor know honor get sit late night like surreal really enjoyed thank talking today yeah mean huge honor feel underqualified big fan listening podcast lot yeah liv would appreciate advice help definitely gon na yeah anytime thank cool thank thanks listening conversation grimes support podcast please check sponsors description let leave words oscar wilde yes dreamer dreamer one find way moonlight punishment sees dawn rest world thank listening hope see next time one day ship put neural lace head neural lace sort like basically neuralink life imitates art indeed indeed wakes opening scene memory uploaded neural lace killed gets choose new body ai interfacing recorded memory neural lace helping like hello dead neural lace memory uploaded want choose new body going born culture like start new life like opening like sick ship super intelligence ships kind super intelligence still want preserve kind rich fulfilling experience humans yeah like like friends humans bunch ships want exist biological beings place like way thing necessarily pretty protopian existence pretty peaceful yeah mean example one main fights book fighting artificial hells people think ethical artificial hell like basically people crime get sent like die memory gets sent artificial hell eternally tortured way society deciding whether artificial hell simulated like simulated war instead actual blood know people basically essentially fighting video game choose outcome still experiencing suffering artificial hell experience stuff artificial hell sucks lot people culture want get rid artificial hell simulated wars happening artificial hell simulated wars happening outside artificial hell political factions political faction says simulated hell deter crime political faction saying simulated hell unethical instead like know blowing nukes like giant fortnite battle decide know protopia like okay war without death know think simulated hells think definitely one ways technology could go wrong almost punishing people digital space something like yeah like torturing people memories either deterrent like committed crime also personal pleasure sick demented humans world dan carlin actually episode hardcore history painful attainment oh episode fucked dark kind goes human history says like humans seem enjoy secretly enjoy used openly enjoy sort torture death watching death torture humans think people consenting allowed gladiatorial matches consent hard achieve situations always starts getting slippery like could also forced consent like starts getting weird way much excitement like highlights something human nature wants see violence really dark hope sort overcome aspect human nature still within us somewhere well think right theory important current moment evolution survival fittest point lines kind fuzzy recent past maybe even right getting point choose intelligent design like probably since like integration iphone like becoming cyborgs like brains fundamentally changed everyone grew electronics fundamentally different previous homo sapiens call us homo techno think evolved homo techno like essentially new species like look way took mri brain took mri like medieval brain think would different way evolved think historians look back time see like fundamental shift human think think still homo sapiens believe homo techno think evolved think right way evolving choose think reckless like social media think idea like time choose intelligent design taken seriously like moment reprogram human computer like go blind visual cortex get taken functions choose evolution change way brains work actually huge responsibility think sure responsible definitely adequate education inundated technology fundamentally changing physical structure brains adequately responding choose wan na evolve could evolve could really whatever want think really important time think choose correctly choose wisely consciousness could exist long time integration ai could extremely positive think enough people focusing specific situation think might irreversibly screw things get things wrong flip side seems humans pretty adaptive maybe way figure things screwing like social media generation see negative effects social media build new social medias keep improving stuff learn failures past humans seem really adaptive flip side get wrong way literally create weapons war increase hate past certain threshold really lot damage mean think optimized notice negative things would actually say one things think people noticing look silicon valley look technocracy like happening silicon valley started facebook profit crap really particular guess useful sort whatever see lab grown meat compostable biodegradable single use cutlery meditation apps think actually evolving changing technology changing think maybe quite enough education also know quite enough incentive think way capitalism works define profit also working old model define profit really think changed idea profit include social good economic profit social good also counting profit would incentivize things useful whatever spiritual technology positive technology things help reprogram human computer good way things help us intelligently design new brains yeah reason within framework capitalism word profit idea profit ca also incorporate well human like long term well long term happiness even example talking motherhood like part reason late get baby bed like keep thinking motherhood capitalism like extremely essential job difficult compensated sort like value things much compensate really devalue motherhood society pretty much societies like capitalism recognize motherhood job supposed free like feel like producing great humans seen great profit capitalism like like huge social good like every awesome human gets made adds much world like integrated profit structure know potentially found way compensate motherhood come compensation much broader money could money like made know know pay like mean start getting reallocation resources people get upset well like made like motherhood dow yeah yeah know used fund like single mothers like know pay making babies mean create put beautiful things onto world could companies bridges could art could lot things could children education anything valued society somehow incorporated framework market like contribute children world valued respected sort celebrated like proportional thing fuels human civilization yeah like kind important feel like everyone always saying mean think different social spheres everyone always saying like dismantle capitalism like well okay well think government everything like think private ownership like scary know like starts getting weird stuff sort like feel almost way without police state know obviously capitalism major flaws think actually mac showed idea called social capitalism form capitalism like considers social good also profit like know like right companies need like supposed grow every quarter whatever like show functioning well like okay well kept amount profit still green also social good like really need extra economic growth could add social good counts know know economist idea could achieved think economists know anything could achieved either pretend thing construct model go tv shows sound like expert definition economist mother becoming mother change human would say man think kind changed everything still changing lot actually changing right moment like today like like recent months stuff elucidate change like wake morning look become different would say think really reorienting priorities first really fighting somehow felt like failure feminism something like felt like like bad like kids started mattering work like recently started sort analyzing thought like also kind construct like devalued motherhood much culture like feel guilty caring kids care work feminism includes breaking whatever construct continually breaking like freedom empower free means also like mother like much creative like believe massive amount brain growth think cause like stakes higher somehow think like trippy watching consciousness emerge like like going crazy journey something like craziest science fiction novel could ever read crazy watching consciousness come time like forced value time much like creative time sacred need like really fricking thing used like cynic used wan na like last album called miss anthropocene like like like study villainy like like well instead old gods like new gods like miss anthropocene like misanthrope like anthropocene like know like goddess climate change whatever like destroying world like like dark like study villainy sort like like used like problem making cynical angry scary art anything wrong think kids makes optimist inherently makes wan na optimist bad like feel responsibility make optimistic things get lot shit everyone like oh privileged stop talking like pie sky stupid concepts focus like like think ideate futures could good wo able get everything blade runner gon na end blade runner like said earlier life imitates art like life really imitate art really need protopian utopian art think incredibly essential future humanity think current discourse seen thinking protopia utopia seen dismissal problems currently think incorrect mindset like kids makes wan na imagine amazing futures like maybe wo able build able build want yeah seem like ideation precursor creation imagine order able build sad thing human nature somehow cynical view world seen insightful view know cynicism often confused insight sad see optimism confused naivete yes yes like blinded maybe privilege whatever blinded something certainly blinded sad sad see seems like optimists ones create future ones build order build crazy thing optimistic either stupid excited passionate mad enough actually believe built people built favorite quote time star wars episode know everyone hates like star wars episode yeah probably would say would probably hate yeah strong feelings let backtrack strong feelings star wars tolkien person dragons orcs ogres yeah mean tolkien forever really want one son call thought tao tecno tolkien would cool lot like yeah well tao six two eight two pi yeah tao tecno yeah yeah yeah techno obviously best genre music also like technocracy sounds really good yeah right techno tolkien tao tecno tolkien good tao tecno tolkien star wars episode know lot people issues personally record think best star wars film starting trouble today yeah kill hate save love kill hate kill hate save love think society right diagnosis mode diagnosing diagnosing diagnosing trying kill hate trying save love enough buckminster fuller quote gon na butcher remember correctly something along lines try destroy old bad models render obsolete better models maybe need destroy oil industry maybe create great new battery technology sustainable transport make economically unreasonable still continue rely fossil fuels like kill hate save love make new things render old things unusable like college debt bad universities expensive feel like education becoming obsolete feel like could completely revolutionize education could make free like look jstor pay get studies everything created dao bought jstor created dao funding studies studies open source free everyone open sourced education decentralized education made free research internet outcomes studies internet one student debt take tests apply job qualified work like know anything works randomly ranting like humility got ta think basic first principles problem broken ideas get excited ideas share excitement tear kill things often end killing like war one sided like gon na go kill like gon na get stabbed like think talk nexus point point society switching intelligent design think part switch intelligent design need choose nonviolence need like think choose start think eradicate violence species think need little bit think choose really reorient primitive brains fighting scarcity attack oriented move optimize creativity building yeah interesting think happens education living life introspecting mind trying live better angels nature one us kinds things scale sort start minimize amount destructive war world probably technology really promising way like social media really promising way way connect know part really enjoy social media know negative stuff engage negative stuff even like blocking kind stuff letting enter mind like like somebody says something negative see immediately think positive thoughts forget exist move like negative energy return negative energy going get excited negative way right back kind vicious cycle would think technology would assist us process letting go taking things personally engaging negativity unfortunately social media profits negativity current models mean social media like gun like take course use like like mean like say reprogram human computer like school learn social media optimizes know raise cortisol levels make angry crazy stressed like learn hygiene use social media yeah choose focus negative stuff know sure social media guess exist sure mean messy experimental phase like working yeah early days even know say social media know even means early days think social media basic human connection digital realm think exist many ways bad way many ways good way discussions human rights talk freedom speech talk sort violence space digital media talk hate speech talk things figure back day physical space figuring digital space like baby stages printing press came like pure chaos minute know like inject massive information injection general population gon na feel like printing press years like printing press came shit got really fucking bad minute got enlightenment like think like second coming printing press probably gon na shitty times minute gon na recalibrate better understanding consume media deliver media speaking programming human computer mentioned baby x young consciousness coming came cell like whole thing even make sense came dna yeah baby computer like grows grows grows grows conscious extremely impressive cognitive capabilities met yes yeah yeah actually really smart really smart yeah weird yeah baby know lot babies seems smart zach hang babies often baby impressive lot pranks stuff oh like like like give treat take away laugh like stuff like like chess player cognitive sort computer programmed taking environment interacting specific set humans would first let ask want ask program computer also make sense conscious right giving lot crisis thoughts thinking really hard think part reason like struggling focus art stuff right cause baby x becoming conscious like reorienting brain like brain suddenly totally shifting like oh shit like way raise children like hate baby books everything hate like oh art bad like stuff everything aesthetics like like ah like programming languages using program baby computers good yeah like thinking like good answers know thinking really really hard recently watched totoro studio ghibli like fantastic film like responded know supposed show baby screens much like think sort like feel like highest art baby content like really speaks almost talking really simple although dialogue super super super simple know like one three year old like really connect like feels like almost aimed like one three year old like great art imaginative beautiful like first time showed like invested unlike ever unlike anything else ever shown like like crying cry laughing laugh like like roller coaster like emotions like learned bunch words like started saying totoro started saying stuff watching totoro wants watch time like man industry like best artists focusing making art like birth consciousness like one things thinking really wan na start know wan na speak things much like like ages one three like putting much effort thing totoro like like better environment adults love totoro good art everyone loves like still old totoro merch kid like literally ragged old totoro merch like everybody loves everybody keeps like art babies need suck accessible adults thrown know age like like know like fully formed thought something thinking lot like like totoroesque content like content like like universal everybody loves like really geared emerging consciousness emerging consciousness first like three years life much turmoil much evolution mind happening seems like crucial time would say make suck think basically treating child like capacity brilliance adult even beyond think mind cause still like talk weird stuff like respond better cause even imitate better voice higher like people say like oh baby talk like voice higher closer something imitate like like baby talk actually kind works like helps learn communicate found effective learning words stuff like speaking like capacity\",\n

unanswerable question sense interesting absolute scale interestingness rate glib answer says human brain part universe right therefore understanding universe fundamental understanding human brain really believe understand fundamental way universe works particle level forces would able understand mind works certainly understand ice cream works understanding particles work right big believer emergence big believer different ways talking world beyond fundamental microscopic one know talk tables chairs planets people talking language particle physics cosmology understanding universe say fundamental level right understanding universe levels part think know little bit fair question probably general principles complexity biology information processing memory knowledge creativity go beyond human brain right maybe one could count understanding part understanding universe human brain far know complex thing universe certainly absurd think understanding fundamental laws particle physics get direct insight brain works step fundamentals particle physics information processing lot physicists philosophers may little bit carelessly take talk artificial intelligence think universe kind computational device like honest answer sense universe processes information clearly sense universe like computer clearly sense think tried say blog one agreed universe like computation computer universe happens computer general purpose machine right ask different questions even pocket calculator right set answer certain kinds questions universe information processing happens universe universe know mit colleague seth lloyd feels differently right well thinking universe closed system makes computer like pc like computing machine human every comes moves mouse around input gives input gives input saying computation deterministic thing unrolling immense complexity nevertheless like processing state changes good rules sense lot people brain operates human brain operates within world simply small subset reason ca build arbitrarily great intelligences yeah think intelligence way intelligence tricky definition offhand remember panel discussion saw youtube seth lloyd panel martin rees famous astrophysicist seth gave shtick universe computer explained martin rees said computer seth like oh good question sure sufficiently broad definition computer everything right simile analogy gains force excludes things know moon going around earth performing computation come definitions answer yes useful computation think absolutely helpful think universe certain situations certain contexts information processing device even guilty writing paper called quantum circuit cosmology modeled whole universe quantum circuit circuit circuit yeah qubits kind thing qubits basically right yeah qubits becoming entangled wan na digress little bit let kind fun mystery universe deep profound nobody talks space expands right talk certain region space certain number degrees freedom certain number ways quantum fields particles region arrange number degrees freedom region space arguably finite actually know many good argument says finite number universe expands space gets bigger degrees freedom infinite number really matter infinity times two still infinity finite number space degrees freedom come would mean universe closed system degrees freedom popping existence suggested degrees freedom start entangled start universe know three dimensions around us see said entangled degrees freedom making space time universe expands whole bunch qubits zero state become entangled rest space time action quantum circuits mean degrees freedom become entangled yeah universe expands right degrees freedom entangled playing part playing role part entangled space time structure basic underlying philosophy space time arises entanglement fundamental quantum degrees freedom wow okay point entanglement happening talking close big bang talking throughout time life throughout history yeah idea big bang almost degrees freedom universe could unentangled anything else reflection fact big bang low entropy simple small place space expands degrees freedom become entangled rest world well ask john carroll think thought experiment nick bostrom living simulation think let contextualize little bit think people actually take thought experiments think quite interesting useful quite interesting perspective ai lot learning done usually happens simulation artificial examples constructive question ask difficult real world simulate right kind dual part living simulation somebody built simulation try hard would obviously could living simulation want physical possibility completely agree physically possible think actually take one piece data consideration know live big universe okay two trillion galaxies observable universe billion stars galaxy et cetera would seem waste resources universe big going simulation words want good bayesian want ask hypothesis expect see first thing would say would expect see universe big okay second thing would expect resolution universe good always possible superhuman simulators finite resources render entire universe right part two trillion galaxies actually simulated fully okay obvious extrapolation simulated fully like rest non player characters right thing real rest chat bots beyond wall see wall literally nothing side wall sort bayesian prediction would like efficient simulation like none seems quite realistic see hear argument possible easy simulate lots things see evidence know universe look like simulated universe maybe say well know would look like abandoning bayesian responsibilities like job say theory would expect see yeah certainly think simulation thing like video game small subset rendered say entire laws physics entire closed system quote unquote universe creator yeah always possible right useful think thinking physics way nick bostrom phrases possible simulate universe eventually right use way lot things well yeah guess question hard create universe wrote little blog post maybe missing something argument says might possible simulate universe probably imagine actually attribute consciousness agency little things simulating little artificial beings probably lot ordinary organic beings universe future right argument simulation possible probable space living consciousnesses simulated right top level think argument must wrong follows argument simulated also simulate things well simulate things simulate things right give enough power resolution ultimately reach bottom laws physics universe bottom made atoms forth cheapest possible simulations believe original argument conclude cheapest possible simulation people look like look like edge resolution bit things seems much easier make much lower level things also questioned whole approach anthropic principle says typical observers universe think actually think lot selection typical within things already know typical within universe think intelligent life however would like define intelligent life universe guess intelligent life observable universe us simply basis fact likely number intelligent species observable universe two likely numbers zero billions billions would noticed already literally like small number like know star trek dozen intelligent civilizations galaxy billion weird sort bizarre easy imagine zero others big bottleneck making multicellular life technological life whatever hard imagine whole bunch somehow remained hidden us question like ask would intelligent life look like mean question going intelligent life big ways different one earth kinds intelligent life operates different scales size temporal right great possibility think humble intelligence life even agree life much less intelligent life right argument humility saying could intelligent life different character right like could imagine dolphins intelligent never invent space travel live ocean thumbs right never invent technology never invent smelting maybe universe full intelligent species make technology right compatible data think think maybe pointing even versions intelligence intelligence intermolecular clouds surface neutron star galaxies giant things equivalent heartbeat million years one hand yes open minded things hand us share laws physics might something laws physics even though currently know exactly thing would makes meters years right length timescales intelligent life maybe made atoms atoms certain size orbit stars stars certain lifetime impossible sweet spot intelligent life find open minded either way open minded either humble sorts different kinds life reason know yet life like kind life yeah two minds often wonder brains designed quite obviously operate see world timescales almost blind tools created detecting things blind kind observation needed see intelligent life scales well totally open another argument would make looked intelligent life looked dumbest way turning radio telescopes sky world would super advanced civilization randomly beam radio signals wastefully directions universe make sense especially order think would actually contact another civilization would forever keep millions years sounds like waste resources thought solar systems planets around maybe intelligent life yet exist might someday would try talk radio waves would send spacecraft would park around would like point view like monolith monolith could artifact fact way works also right could artifacts solar system put technologically advanced civilizations eventually contact explored solar system well enough yet find reason think young impatient right like would take lifetime actually send something another star system wait come back start thinking hundreds thousands years million year time scales clearly right thing excited thing elon musk spacex general space idea space exploration even though species young impatient yeah think space travel crucially important long term even star systems think many people overestimate difficulty say look travel speed light another star system dead get right think much easier therefore write science fiction stories imagine go faster speed light otherwise impatient right gon na go faster speed light could easily imagine human lifespan gets extended thousands years stars much closer effectively right hundred year trip right think gon na future far future lifetime baby steps unless lifetime gets extended well race time right friend mine actually thinks things said know gon na die know grandchildren know predicting future hard least plausible scenario yeah think discussed earlier threats earth known unknown right spread humanity biology elsewhere really important longterm goal kind questions science currently answer might soon think problems mysteries us may within reach science think obvious one origin life know happened difficulty knowing happened historically actually know literally earth starting life non life something kind think close right really really think like difficult start life well talked people including podcast know life requires three things life know difference life knows life know talk intelligence life know requires compartmentalization need like little membrane around cell metabolism need take food eat let make things replication okay need information pass future generations lab compartmentalization seems pretty easy hard make lipid bilayers come little cellular walls pretty easily metabolism replication hard replication close people made rna like molecules lab think state art able make one molecule reproduces able make two molecules reproduce okay pretty close metabolism harder believe even though sort obvious thing want sort controlled metabolism actual cellular machinery bodies quite complicated hard see popping existence probably took making progress fact think spending nearly enough money nsf would flood area money would change view world could actually make life lab understand made originally earth sure ripple effects help cure disease mean understanding synthetic biology wonderful big frontier making cells right best way borrow heavily existing biology right well craig venter several years ago created artificial cell tremendous accomplishment take dna cell put entirely new dna let boot go leap creating intelligent life earth yeah define intelligence course let even say homo sapiens modern intelligence human brain sense involved leap big leap ai would count really want life want really organism sense ai would count think okay yeah course course ai would count well let say artificial consciousness right think threshold creating artificial consciousness think possible educated close impression really close understand little understand consciousness idea hard imagine threshold making doable possible see obstacles principle yeah would hold interest happening eventually think general consciousness think would surprised easy consciousness create intelligence think consciousness thing something fake well good actually like idea fact consciousness way less mysterious think every time every moment less conscious think right fool things think plus idea artificial intelligent systems put body right give robot body help faking lot yeah think creating consciousness artificial consciousness simple asking roomba say conscious refusing talked could could mean almost silly kind consciousness also social construct lot ideas intelligence social construct reaching bar involves something beyond necessarily involve fundamental understanding go electrons neurons cognition actually think extremely good point fact suggests yeah referred kate darling podcast experiments simple robots look like animals look like experiencing pain human beings react negatively little robots looking like experiencing pain wan na say yeah robots really pain right electrons going around realize electrons going around pain also would easy time
